Although the specific function of αS is still unclear, a general consensus is forming that it has a key role in regulating the process of neurotransmitter release, which is associated with the mediation of synaptic vesicle interactions and assembly. Here we report the analysis of wild-type αS and two mutational variants linked to familial Parkinson's disease to describe the structural basis of a molecular mechanism enabling αS to induce the clustering of synaptic vesicles. We provide support for this 'double-anchor' mechanism by rationally designing and experimentally testing a further mutational variant of αS engineered to promote stronger interactions between synaptic vesicles. Our results characterize the nature of the active conformations of αS that mediate the clustering of synaptic vesicles, and indicate their relevance in both functional and pathological contexts.},

   abstract = {Alpha-synuclein (aS) is a 140-amino-acid protein that is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease, the protein is typically encountered in intracellular, high-molecular-weight aggregates. Although αSis abundant in the presynaptic terminals of the central nervous system, its physiological function is still unknown. There is strong evidence for the membrane affinity of the protein. One hypothesis is that lipid-induced binding and helix folding may modulate the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and the ensuing transmitter release. Here we show that membrane recognition of the N-terminus is essential for the cooperative formation of helical domains in the protein. We used circular dichroism spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate synthetic peptide fragments from different domains of the full-length aS protein. Site-specific truncation and partial cleavage of the full-length protein were employed to further characterize the structural motifs responsible for helix formation and lipid-protein interaction. Unilamellar vesicles of varying net charge and lipid compositions undergoing lateral phase separation or chain melting phase transitions in the vicinity of physiological temperatures served as model membranes. The results suggest that the membrane-induced helical folding of the first 25 residues may be driven simultaneously by electrostatic attraction and by a change in lipid ordering. Our findings highlight the significance of the aS N-terminus for folding nucleation, and provide a framework for elucidating the role of lipid-induced conformational transitions of the protein within its intracellular milieu. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

In addition to its random-coil state, α-syn can adopt an α-helical structure upon lipid membrane binding or a β-sheet structure upon aggregation. We used yeast biology and in vitro biochemistry to detect how sequence changes alter the structural propensity of α-syn. The N-terminus of the protein, which adopts an α-helical conformation upon lipid binding, is essential for membrane binding in yeast, and variants that are more prone to forming an α-helical structure in vitro are generally more toxic to yeast. β-Sheet structure and inclusion formation, on the other hand, appear to be protective, possibly by sequestering the protein from the membrane. Surprisingly, sequential deletion of residues 2 through 11 caused a dramatic drop in α-helical propensity, vesicle binding in vitro, and membrane binding and toxicity in yeast, part of which could be mimicked by mutating aspartic acid at position 2 to alanine. Variants with distinct structural preferences, identified here by a reductionist approach, provide valuable tools for elucidating the nature of toxic forms of α-syn in neurons. © 2009.},

Using CEST-NMR, we reveal that alpha-synuclein interacts with isolated synaptic vesicles with two regions, the N terminus, already known from studies on SUVs, and additionally via its C terminus, which is regulated by the binding of calcium. Indeed, dSTORM on synaptosomes shows that calcium mediates the localization of alpha-synuclein at the pre-synaptic terminal, and an imbalance in calcium or alpha-synuclein can cause synaptic vesicle clustering, as seen ex vivo and in vitro.

The impact of this modification on the protein's structure and dynamics in free solution and on its membrane binding properties has been evaluated by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. While no tetrameric form of acetylated aS could be isolated, N-terminal acetylation resulted in chemical shift perturbations of the first 12 residues of the protein that progressively decreased with the distance from the N-terminus. The directions of the chemical shift changes and small changes in backbone (3)J(HH) couplings are consistent with an increase in the α-helicity of the first six residues of aS, although a high degree of dynamic conformational disorder remains and the helical structure is sampled <20% of the time. Chemical shift and (3)J(HH) data for the intact protein are virtually indistinguishable from those recorded for the corresponding N-terminally acetylated and nonacetylated 15-residue synthetic peptides. An increase in α-helicity at the N-terminus of aS is supported by CD data on the acetylated peptide and by weak medium-range nuclear Overhauser effect contacts indicative of α-helical character. The remainder of the protein has chemical shift values that are very close to random coil values and indistinguishable between the two forms of the protein. No significant differences in the fibrillation kinetics were observed between acetylated and nonacetylated aS. However, the lipid binding properties of aS are strongly impacted by acetylation and exhibit distinct behavior for the first 12 residues, indicative of an initiation role for the N-terminal residues in an "initiation-elongation" process of binding to the membrane.},

Here we model a reaction-diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology study in mammalian cells. The model employs a single promoter to express both the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions of parameter space, using biologically-interpretable Hill function reactions. We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning. We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating the values for production, and degradation relationships. More importantly, our analysis predicts that steep dose-response functions arising from cooperativity are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios for reaction-diffusion systems and will help guide projects to engineer synthetic Turing patterns.},

Here we report the first systematic investigation of Turing patterns in large random networks, which reveals their striking difference from the known classical behavior. In such networks, Turing instability leads to spontaneous differentiation of the network nodes into activator-rich and activator-low groups, but ordered periodic structures never develop. Only a subset of nodes having close degrees (numbers of links) undergoes differentiation, with its characteristic degree obeying a simple general law. Strong nonlinear restructuring process leads to multiple coexisting states and hysteresis effects.

A surprisingly large fraction (>60%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. Importantly, we deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 95% of networks implementing them produce TPs).

Unlike experimental vesicles, the fused vesicles in molecular dynamics simulations do not become spherical readily, because the lipid and water distribution is inappropriate for the fused state and spontaneous amendment is slow. Here, we study the hypothesis that enhanced transport across the membrane of water, lipids, or both is required to produce spherical vesicles. This is done by adding several kinds of model proteins to fusing vesicles. The results show that equilibration of both water and lipid content is a requirement for spherical vesicles. In addition, the effect of these transmembrane proteins is studied in bilayers and vesicles, including investigations into Hydrophobic matching and aggregation. Our simulations show that the level of aggregation does not only depend on hydrophobic mismatch, but also on protein shape. Additionally, one of the proteins promotes fusion by inducing pore formation. Incorporation of these proteins allows even flat membranes to fuse spontaneously. Moreover, we encountered a novel spontaneous vesicle enlargement mechanism we call the engulfing lobe, which may explain how lipids added to a vesicle solution are quickly incorporated into the inner monolayer. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

We report that alpha-synuclein binds to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge. We further show that the protein associates preferentially with vesicles of smaller diameter (20-25 nm) as opposed to larger (approximately 125 nm) vesicles.

The oligomers formed as a result of the structural conversion generate much higher levels of oxidative stress in rat primary neurons than do the oligomers formed initially, showing that they are more damaging to cells. The structural conversion is remarkably slow, indicating a high kinetic barrier for the conversion and suggesting that there is a significant period of time for the cellular protective machinery to operate and potentially for therapeutic intervention, prior to the onset of cellular damage. In the absence of added soluble protein, the assembly process is reversed and fibrils disaggregate to form stable oligomers, hence acting as a source of cytotoxic species. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this mini-review, we summarize the recent discoveries of α-syn structures in the membrane-bound state, in cytosol, and in the amyloid state under physiological and pathological conditions. From the current knowledge on different structural species of α-syn, we intend to find a clue about its function and toxicity in normal neurons and under disease conditions, which could shed light on the PD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {The intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We show here that the native state of α-synuclein consists of a broad distribution of conformers with an ensemble-averaged hydrodynamic radius significantly smaller than that expected for a random coil structure. This partial condensation is driven by interactions between the highly charged C-terminus and a large hydrophobic central region of the protein sequence. We suggest that this structure could inhibit the formation of α-synuclein aggregates, which are thought to be the cytotoxic species responsible for neurodegeneration in PD.

   abstract = {alpha-Synuclein, an acidic neuronal protein of 140 amino acids, is extremely heat-resistant and is natively unfolded. Recent studies have demonstrated that alpha-synuclein has chaperone activity both in vitro and in vivo, and that this activity is lost upon removing its C-terminal acidic tail. However, the detailed mechanism of the chaperone action of alpha-synuclein remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the chaperone action of alpha-synuclein by analyzing the roles of its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-95) was found to bind to substrate proteins to form high molecular weight complexes, whereas the C-terminal acidic tail (residues 96-140) appears to be primarily involved in solubilizing the high molecular weight complexes. Because the substrate-binding domain and the solubilizing domain for chaperone function are well separated in alpha-synuclein, the N-terminal-binding domain can be substituted by other proteins or peptides. Interestingly, the resultant engineered chaperone proteins appeared to display differential efficiency and specificity in terms of the chaperone function, which depended upon the nature of the binding domain. This finding implies that the C-terminal acidic tail of alpha-synuclein can be fused with other proteins or peptides to engineer synthetic chaperones for specific purposes.},

   abstract = {Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2–3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphos-phatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.},

   abstract = {The origin of biological morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator–inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator–inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator–inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.},

Motivated by the question of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity. The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing’s model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin. New examples of ‘Turing patterns’ in biology and beyond are still being discovered today.

Current mathematical understanding of patterning is typically restricted to systems of two or three chemical species, for which equations are tractable. However, when models seek to combine descriptions of intercellular signal diffusion and intracellular biochemistry, plausible genetic networks can consist of dozens of interacting species. In this paper, we suggest a method for reducing large biochemical systems that relies on removing the non-diffusible species, leaving only the diffusibles in the model. Such model reduction enables analysis to be conducted on a smaller number of differential equations. We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice versa. We confirm our technique with three examples: the Brusselator, an example proposed by Turing, and a biochemically plausible patterning system consisting of 17 species. These examples show that our method significantly simplifies the study of pattern formation in large systems where several species can be considered immobile.},

   abstract = {One of the elementary processes in morphogenesis is the formation of a spatial pattern of tissue structures, starting from almost homogeneous tissue. It will be shown that relatively simple molecular mechanisms based on auto-and cross catalysis can account for a primary pattern of morphogens to determine pattern formation of the tissue. The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto-and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation. Employing an approximative equation, a criterium is derived for models, which lead to a striking pattern, starting from an even distribution of morphogens, and assuming a shallow source gradient. The polarity of the pattern depends on the direction of the source gradient, but can be rather independent of other features of source distribution, Models are proposed which explain size regulation (constant proportion of the parts of the pattern irrespective of total size). Depending on the choice of constants, aperiodic patterns, implying a one-to-one correlation between morphogen concentration and position in the tissue, or nearly periodic patterns can be obtained. The theory can be applied not only to multicellular tissues, but also to intracellular differentiation, e.g. of polar cells. The theory permits various molecular interpretations. One of the simplest models involves bimolecular activation and mono-molecular inhibition. Source gradients may be substituted by, or added to, sink gradients, e.g. of degrading enzymes. Inhibitors can be substituted by substances required for, and depleted by activation. Sources may be either synthesizing systems or particulate structures releasing activators and inhibitors. Calculations by computer are presented to exemplify the main features of the theory proposed. The theory is applied to quantitative data on hydra-a suitable one-dimensional model for pattern formation-and is shown to account for activation and inhibition of secondary head formation.},

A large fraction (>61%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure, and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. We deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 92% of networks implementing them produce TPs).

All possible 2, 3-node genetic regulatory networks are enumerated and linear stability analysis is applied to access their ability to generate Turing instability. We find that all 3-node networks that can achieve Turing pattern can be mapped to either pure or cross activator-inhibitor mechanisms, and the pure activator-inhibitor system is more robust for Turing pattern formation than the other one. Additional linkages can further increase the performance of the circuit by either introducing another core topology or complementing existing regulations. Moreover, we find that addition of a fixed node enables the formation of Turing pattern even when the diffusion coefficients of two morphogens are fairly close to each other. Our results provide the design principle of robust circuits for Turing pattern generation and can be further applied for systematically exploring other bifurcation phenomena.},

   abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural base-line against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

   abstract = {1. System design Turing-type pattern formation is based on short range activation and long range inhibition in a system of interacting "morphogen" species. As shown by Gierer and Meinhardt, one short range, dissipative "activator" morphogen must be autocatalytic, and there are two general possibilities for the longer range morphogen (1). In one type of system, the longer range species inhibits the activator. Alternatively, the longer range species may serve as a substrate necessary for catalysis of the activator, and the long range inhibition effectively occurs through depletion of this substrate. Implementing Turing pattern formation in cells requires two non-interacting intercellular signaling pathways such that one signal serves as the "activator," while the other serves as either the "inhibitor" or "substrate." We chose to use elements from the Las and Rhl quorum sensing systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, such that A 3OC12HSL is effectively the "activator" and I C4HSL is the "inhibitor" (Fig. S1a). Evidence suggested that certain promoters in P. aeruginosa respond specifically to either I C4HSL /RhlR or A 3OC12HSL /LasR (2-4). These systems were also appealing due to the different diffusion properties of the A 3OC12HSL and I C4HSL signal molecules (5). We explore these signal specificity and diffusion aspects in detail in later sections. Designing complex multicellular systems such as a Turing pattern formation system requires the use of computational modeling. Many more reactions are necessary for a biological implementation than for a simple chemical implementation, as the activator and inhibitor do not directly interact. Rather, the system in Figure S1a must be implemented through several signal-protein, protein-protein, and protein-DNA interactions. Due to the number of reactions and of different design variations possible, computational modeling is critical for guiding the translation of the abstract design in Figure S1a into a genetic network. As a starting point, we explored the genetic network design shown in Figure S1b. In this system, A 3OC12HSL binds LasR and activates two different p(Las)-OR1 promoters that express lasI and rhlI. Since LasI catalyzes A 3OC12HSL synthesis, A 3OC12HSL is effectively autocatalytic. Similarly, since RhlI catalyzes synthesis of I C4HSL , the A 3OC12HSL activator also activates the I C4HSL inhibitor. I C4HSL binds RhlR and activates the p(Rhl) promoter, which expresses the λ phage CI repressor. CI represses the two p(Las)-OR1 promoters and thus inhibits further production of A 3OC12HSL and I C4HSL. CI also represses the p(Rhl)-OR1 promoter. We developed a detailed model of this system and confirmed through linear stability analysis that Turing instabilities could be achieved for certain parameter sets, and also confirmed through spatial simulations that patterns could form (6). We then proceeded to consider design modifications that could potentially result in more robust patterning. One of the overall design goals was to create a network enriched for Turing instabilities but simple enough to physically construct and tune. In order to increase the chances of finding parameter sets with Turing instabilities without making the system much more complex, we developed code to perform stability analysis on random parameter sets for different design variations. As shown in Figure S2a, these alternative implementations had CI OR1 binding domains in different combinations of promoters, and some expressed a A 3OC12HSL degrading acylase from the p(Rhl) promoter (7). Equations 1-27 were used to model the design variations, and kinetic rates were chosen according to Tables S1-S3. This model explicitly captures production and decay of mRNA, production and decay of proteins, and binding and dissociation of AHL and R-proteins. However, quasi steady state approximations were used for protein-DNA interactions. As found by other synthetic biology studies (8), detailed models of this nature can be important for capturing delays that impact system function.},

   abstract = {Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

   abstract = {Background: In systems biology, the dynamics of biological networks are often modeled with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that encode interacting components in the systems, resulting in highly complex models. In contrast, the amount of experimentally available data is almost always limited, and insufficient to constrain the parameters. In this situation, parameter estimation is a very challenging problem. To address this challenge, two intuitive approaches are to perform experimental design to generate more data, and to perform model reduction to simplify the model. Experimental design and model reduction have been traditionally viewed as two distinct areas, and an extensive literature and excellent reviews exist on each of the two areas. Intriguingly, however, the intrinsic connections between the two areas have not been recognized. Results: Experimental design and model reduction are deeply related, and can be considered as one unified framework. There are two recent methods that can tackle both areas, one based on model manifold and the other based on profile likelihood. We use a simple sum-of-two-exponentials example to discuss the concepts and algorithmic details of both methods, and provide Matlab-based code and implementation which are useful resources for the dissemination and adoption of experimental design and model reduction in the biology community. Conclusions: From a geometric perspective, we consider the experimental data as a point in a high-dimensional data space and the mathematical model as a manifold living in this space. Parameter estimation can be viewed as a projection of the data point onto the manifold. By examining the singularity around the projected point on the manifold, we can perform both experimental design and model reduction. Experimental design identifies new experiments that expand the manifold and remove the singularity, whereas model reduction identifies the nearest boundary, which is the nearest singularity that suggests an appropriate form of a reduced model. This geometric interpretation represents one step toward the convergence of experimental design and model reduction as a unified framework. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

   abstract = {Understanding the collective behavior of complex systems from their basic components is a difficult yet fundamental problem in science. Existing model reduction techniques are either applicable under limited circumstances or produce "black boxes" disconnected from the microscopic physics. We propose a new approach by translating the model reduction problem for an arbitrary statistical model into a geometric problem of constructing a low-dimensional, submanifold approximation to a high-dimensional manifold. When models are overly complex, we use the observation that the model manifold is bounded with a hierarchy of widths and propose using the boundaries as submanifold approximations. We refer to this approach as the manifold boundary approximation method. We apply this method to several models, including a sum of exponentials, a dynamical systems model of protein signaling, and a generalized Ising model. By focusing on parameters rather than physical degrees of freedom, the approach unifies many other model reduction techniques, such as singular limits, equilibrium approximations, and the renormalization group, while expanding the domain of tractable models. The method produces a series of approximations that decrease the complexity of the model and reveal how microscopic parameters are systematically "compressed" into a few macroscopic degrees of freedom, effectively building a bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic descriptions. Models of complex systems are often built by combining several microscopic elements together. This constructionist approach to modeling is a powerful tool, finding widespread use in many fields, such as molecular dynamics [1-3], systems biology [4-6], climate [7,8], economics [9], and many others [10-12]. Nevertheless, it is not without its pitfalls, most of which arise as models grow in scale and complexity. Overly complex models can be problematic if they are computationally expensive, numerically unstable [13], or difficult to fit to data [14]. These problems, however, are only manifestations of a more fundamental issue. Specifically, although reductionism implies that the system behavior ultimately derives from the same fundamental laws as its basic components, this does not imply that the collective behavior can easily be understood in terms of these laws [15,16]. The collective behavior of the system is typically compressed into a few key parameter combinations while most other combinations remain irrelevant [17]. The system therefore exhibits novel behavior that emerges from the collective interactions of its microscopic},

Parametric and structural uncertainty, as well as combinatorial explosion are strong obstacles against analyzing the dynamics of large models of this type. Multiscaleness, an important property of these networks, can be used to get past some of these obstacles. Networks with many well separated time scales, can be reduced to simpler models, in a way that depends only on the orders of magnitude and not on the exact values of the kinetic parameters. The main idea used for such robust simplifications of networks is the concept of dominance among model elements, allowing hierarchical organization of these elements according to their effects on the network dynamics. This concept finds a natural formulation in tropical geometry. We revisit, in the light of these new ideas, the main approaches to model reduction of reaction networks, such as quasi-steady state (QSS) and quasi-equilibrium approximations (QE), and provide practical recipes for model reduction of linear and non-linear networks. We also discuss the application of model reduction to the problem of parameter identification, via backward pruning machine learning techniques. © 2012 Radulescu, Gorban, Zinovyev and Noel.},

On the other hand, the collective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a relatively small number of phenomenological parameters. We use the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving simple phenomenological models from complicated mechanistic models. The resulting models are not black boxes, but remain expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters. In this way, we explicitly connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, characterize the equivalence class of distinct systems exhibiting the same range of collective behavior, and identify the combinations of components that function as tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the procedure for adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48 parameter mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a single adaptation parameter τ characterizing the ratio of time scales for the initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be expressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, and biochemical concentrations. The situation is not unlike modeling in physics in which microscopically complex processes can often be renormalized into simple phenomenological models with only a few effective parameters. The proposed method additionally provides a mechanistic explanation for non-universal features of the behavior.},

   abstract = {To characterize the behavior and robustness of cellular circuits with many unknown parameters is a major challenge for systems biology. Its difficulty rises exponentially with the number of circuit components. We here propose a novel analysis method to meet this challenge. Our method identifies the region of a high-dimensional parameter space where a circuit displays an experimentally observed behavior. It does so via a Monte Carlo approach guided by principal component analysis, in order to allow efficient sampling of this space. This 'global' analysis is then supplemented by a 'local' analysis, in which circuit robustness is determined for each of the thousands of parameter sets sampled in the global analysis. We apply this method to two prominent, recent models of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, an autocatalytic model, and a model centered on consecutive phosphorylation at two sites of the KaiC protein, a key circadian regulator. For these models, we find that the two-sites architecture is much more robust than the autocatalytic one, both globally and locally, based on five different quantifiers of robustness, including robustness to parameter perturbations and to molecular noise. Our 'glocal' combination of global and local analyses can also identify key causes of high or low robustness. In doing so, our approach helps to unravel the architectural origin of robust circuit behavior. Complementarily, identifying fragile aspects of system behavior can aid in designing perturbation experiments that may discriminate between competing mechanisms and different parameter sets. © 2009 Hafner et al.},

In systems with a large number of biochemical parameters, viable regions with potentially complex geometries fill a tiny fraction of the whole parameter space. This hampers explorations of the viable space based on "brute force" or Gaussian sampling.Results: We here propose a novel algorithm to characterize viable spaces efficiently. The algorithm combines global and local explorations of a parameter space. The global exploration involves an out-of-equilibrium adaptive Metropolis Monte Carlo method aimed at identifying poorly connected viable regions. The local exploration then samples these regions in detail by a method we call multiple ellipsoid-based sampling. Our algorithm explores efficiently nonconvex and poorly connected viable regions of different test-problems. Most importantly, its computational effort scales linearly with the number of dimensions, in contrast to "brute force" sampling that shows an exponential dependence on the number of dimensions. We also apply this algorithm to a simplified model of a biochemical oscillator with positive and negative feedback loops. A detailed characterization of the model's viable space captures well known structural properties of circadian oscillators. Concretely, we find that model topologies with an essential negative feedback loop and a nonessential positive feedback loop provide the most robust fixed period oscillations. Moreover, the connectedness of the model's viable space suggests that biochemical oscillators with varying topologies can evolve from one another.Conclusions: Our algorithm permits an efficient analysis of high-dimensional, nonconvex, and poorly connected viable spaces characteristic of complex biological circuitry.

In this work, the phenomena of emergence of Turing patterns are studied and do not fit into this concept, yielding the following results. (1) The criteria are derived, under which a reaction-diffusion system with immobile species should spontaneously produce Turing patterns under any diffusion coefficients of its mobile species. It is shown for such systems that under certain sets of types of interactions between their species, Turing patterns should be produced under any parameter values, at least provided that the corresponding spatially non-distributed system is stable. (2) It is demonstrated that in a reaction-diffusion system, which contains more than two species and is stable in absence of diffusion, the presence of a sufficiently slowly diffusing unstable subsystem is already sufficient for diffusion instability (i.e., Turing or wave instability), while its complementary subsystem can also be unstable. (3) It is shown that the presence of an immobile unstable subsystem, which leads to destabilization of waves within an infinite range of wavenumbers, in a spatially discrete case can result in the generation of large-scale stationary or oscillatory patterns. (4) It is demonstrated that under the presence of subcritical Turing and supercritical wave bifurcations, the interaction of two diffusion instabilities can result in the spontaneous formation of Turing structures outside the region of Turing instability.},

Meanwhile, synthetic biologists have designed Turing systems for implementation in cell colonies, but none have yet led to visible patterns in the laboratory. In both cases, the relationship between underlying chemistry and emergent biology remains mysterious. To help resolve the mystery, this article asks the question: what kinds of biochemical systems can generate Turing patterns? We find general conditions for Turing pattern inception -- the ability to generate unstable patterns from random noise -- which may lead to the ultimate formation of stable patterns, depending on biochemical non-linearities. We find that a wide variety of systems can generate stable Turing patterns, including several which are currently unknown, such as two-species systems composed of two self-activators, and systems composed of a short-range inhibitor and a long-range activator. We furthermore find that systems which are widely believed to generate stable patterns may in fact only generate unstable patterns, which ultimately converge to spatially-homogeneous concentrations. Our results suggest that a much wider variety of systems than is commonly believed could be responsible for observed patterns in development, or could be good candidates for synthetic patterning networks.},

   abstract = {Multicellular entities are characterized by exquisite spatial patterns, intimately related to the functions they perform. Oftentimes these patterns emerge as periodic structures with a well-defined characteristic scale. A candidate mechanism to explain their origins was early introduced by Alan Turing through the interaction and diffusion of two so called morphogens. Unfortunately, most available evidence for Turing patterns in biology is usually obscured by the tangled nature of regulatory phenomena, making difficult to validate Turing's proposal in developmental processes. Here we follow a different approach, by designing synthetic genetic circuits in engineered E. coli strains that implement the essential activator-inhibitor motif (AIM) using a two-cell consortium. The two diffusible compartments are one cell type (activator, small-diffusion component) and a small signal molecule (a homoserine lactone, acting as the fast-diffusing inhibitor). Using both experimental results, we show that the AIM is capable of generating diffusion-induced instabilities leading to regular spatial patterns. The artificial construction taken here can help validate developmental theories and identify universal properties underpinning biological pattern formation. The implications of the work for the area of synthetic developmental biology are outlined.},

   abstract = {Camouflage typically involves colour patterns that match the background. However, it has been argued that concealment may be achieved by strategic use of apparently conspicuous markings. Recent evidence supports the theory that the presence of contrasting patterns placed peripherally on an animal's body (disruptive coloration) provides survival advantages. However, no study has tested a key prediction from the early literature that disruptive coloration is effective even when some colour patches do not match the background and have a high contrast with both the background and adjacent pattern elements (disruptive contrast). We test this counter-intuitive idea that conspicuous patterns might aid concealment, using artificial moth-like targets with pattern elements designed to match or mismatch the average luminance (lightness) of the trees on which they were placed. Disruptive coloration was less effective when some pattern elements did not match the background luminance. However, even non-background-matching disruptive patterns reduced predation relative to equivalent non-disruptive patterns or to unpatterned controls. Therefore, concealment may still be achieved even when an animal possesses markings not found in the background. Disruptive coloration may allow animals to exploit backgrounds on which they are not perfectly matched, and to possess conspicuous markings while still retaining a degree of camouflage. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

To create these patterns plants must control the divergence angle between the appearance of successive organs, sometimes to within a fraction of a degree. The most common angle is the Fibonacci or golden angle, and its prevalence has led to the hypothesis that it has been selected by evolution as optimal for plants with respect to some fitness benefits, such as light capture. We explore arguments for and against this idea with computer models. We have used both idealized and scanned leaves from Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta to measure the overlapping leaf area of simulated plants after varying parameters such as leaf shape, incident light angles, and other leaf traits. We find that other angles generated by Fibonacci-like series found in nature are equally optimal for light capture, and therefore should be under similar evolutionary pressure. Our findings suggest that the iterative mechanism for organ positioning itself is a more likely target for evolutionary pressure, rather than a specific divergence angle, and our model demonstrates that the heteroblastic progression of leaf shape in A. thaliana can provide a potential fitness benefit via light capture.},

However, this pattern forming possibility has never been directly tested, and the underlying mechanisms of differential diffusivity of Nodal and Lefty remain unclear. Here, through a combination of synthetic and theoretical approaches, we show that a reconstituted Nodal-Lefty network in mammalian cells spontaneously gives rise to a pattern. Surprisingly, extracellular Nodal is confined underneath the cells, resulting in a narrow distribution compared with Lefty. The short-range distribution requires the finger 1 domain of Nodal, and transplantation of the finger 1 domain into Lefty shortens the distribution of Lefty, successfully preventing pattern formation. These results indicate that the differences in localization and domain structures between Nodal and Lefty, combined with the activator-inhibitor topology, are sufficient for reaction-diffusion patterning.},

@article{Purwins2010,
   abstract = {The present review summarizes experimental and theoretical work dealing with self-organized solitary localized structures (LSs) that are observed in spatially extended nonlinear dissipative systems otherwise exhibiting translational and rotational symmetry. Thereby we focus on those LSs that essentially behave like particles and that we call dissipative solitons (DSs). Such objects are also solutions of corresponding nonlinear evolution equations and it turns out that they are rather robust with respect to interaction with each other, with impurities, and with the boundary; alternatively they are generated or annihilated as a whole. By reviewing the experimental results it turns out that the richest variety of DS phenomena has been observed in electrical transport systems and optical devices. Nevertheless, DSs show up also in many other systems, among which nerve pulses in living beings are of uppermost importance in practice. In most of these systems DSs behave very similarly. The experimental results strongly suggest that phenomenon of DSs is universal. On the background of the experimental findings models for a theoretical understanding are discussed. It turns out that in a limited number of cases a straightforward quantitative description of DS patterns can be carried out. However, for the overwhelming number of systems only a qualitative approach has been successful so far. In the present review particular emphasis is laid on reaction-diffusion systems for which a kind of 'normal form' can be written down that defines a relatively large universality class comprising e.g. important electrical transport, chemical, and biological systems. For the other large class of DS carrying systems, namely optical devices, the variety of model equations is much larger and one is far away, even from a universal qualitative description. Because of this, and due to the existence of several extensive reviews on optical systems, their theoretical treatment has been mentioned only shortly. Finally, it is demonstrated that in terms of a singular perturbation approach the interaction of DSs and important aspects of their bifurcation behaviour, under certain conditions, can be described by rather simple equations. This is also true when deriving from the underlying field equations a set of ordinary differential equations containing the position coordinates of the individual DSs. Such equations represent a theoretical foundation of the experimentally observed particle-like behaviour of DSs. Though at present there is little real practical application of DSs and related patterns in an outlook we point out in which respects this might change in future.

   abstract = {The problem of pattern is considered in terms of how genetic information can be translated in a reliable manner to give specific and different spatial patterns of cellular differentiation. Pattern formation thus differs from molecular differentiation which is mainly concerned with the control of synthesis of specific macromolecules within cells rather than the spatial arrangement of the cells. It is suggested that there may be a universal mechanism whereby the translation of genetic information into spatial patterns of differentiation is achieved. The basis of this is a mechanism whereby the cells in a developing system may have their position specified with respect to one or more points in the system. This specification of position is positional information. Cells which have their positional information specified with respect to the same set of points constitute a field. Positional information largely determines with respect to the cells' genome and developmental history the nature of its molecular differentiation. The specification of positional information in general precedes and is independent of molecular differentiation. The concept of positional information implies a coordinate system and polarity is defined as the direction in which positional information is specified or measured. Rules for the specification of positional information and polarity are discussed. Pattern regulation, which is the ability of the system to form the pattern even when parts are removed, or added, and to show size invariance as in the French Flag problem, is largely dependent on the ability of the cells to change their positional information and interpret this change. These concepts are applied in some detail to early sea urchin development, hydroid regeneration, pattern formation in the insect epidermis, and the development of the chick limb. It is concluded that these concepts provide a unifying framework within which a wide variety of patterns formed from fields may be discussed, and give new meaning to classical concepts such as induction, dominance and field. The concepts direct attention towards finding mechanisms whereby position and polarity are specified, and the nature of reference points and boundaries. More specifically, it is suggested that the mechanism is required to specify the position of about $ This work was first presented at the 3rd Serbelloni Meeting on Theoretical Biology, Easter, 1968 (see Wolpert, 1969).

Considering the properties of the pattern (symmetry breaking, intrinsic wavelength), it is interpreted as the first unambiguous experimenta. evidence of a Turing structure. PACS numbers: 82.20.Mj, 05.70.Ln Because of their supposed role in morphogenesis, the possible emergence of Turing structures in single-phase chemical systems maintained far from equilibrium by a permanent supply of reactants, first asserted in 1952, ' has been the subject of a tremendous amount of theoretical study summarized in various textbooks. As some confusion prevails about this term, let us make clear what we mean by "Turing structures" and what are their main properties. These are stationary concentration patterns , originating in the sole coupling of reaction and diffusion processes. In particular, patterns involving convection or any type of hydrodynamic motion are excluded. The Turing patterns result from spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena associated with bifurca-tions of steady states (often known as nonequilibrium phase transitions or self-organization phenomena). They correspond to stable stationary solutions of a set of reaction digusio-n equations, Bc;/Bt = f;(.. . , ci,. . .)+D,ac;, where the nonlinear functions f; of the concentrations c, represent the contribution of reactive processes, the D; are the diffusion coefficients, and 5 is the Laplacian operator which brings in the spatial dependence. The patterns are characterized by an intrinsic wavelength which does not depend on the geometrical parameters but only on the concentrations or input rates of the reac-tants, the diffusion coefficients, and the macroscopic reaction rates. This distinguishes the Turing patterns from the other well-known nonequilibrium structures like the convective Benard cells or the Taylor vortices in Couette flows, which depend on some geometric length of the system. 8 In Turing patterns such a dependence occurs only when the size of the system is smaller than a few wavelengths-due to the necessary fit with the boundary conditions-but disappears at larger sizes. In most studies , the pattern originates, as in Ref. 1, from the instability of the homogeneous steady state in a system where the concentrations of input and output reactants are assumed to be kept constant in space and time, but Turing patterns can also form in systems fed by diffusion of reactants from the boundaries. ' The latter are more relevant for our experiments. The necessary conditions for Turing patterns are stringent. First, the kinetics should include a positive feedback-such as autocatalysis-on a species called ac-tivator and an inhibitory process. Such conditions are readily fulfilled in the few reactions which exhibit bi-stable or oscillatory behavior.

We outline the basic features of synthetic biology as a new engineering discipline, covering examples from the latest literature and reflecting on the features that make it unique among all other existing engineering fields. We discuss methods for designing and constructing engineered cells with novel functions in a framework of an abstract hierarchy of biological devices, modules, cells, and multicellular systems. The classical engineering strategies of standardization, decoupling, and abstraction will have to be extended to take into account the inherent characteristics of biological devices and modules. To achieve predictability and reliability, strategies for engineering biology must include the notion of cellular context in the functional definition of devices and modules, use rational redesign and directed evolution for system optimization, and focus on accomplishing tasks using cell populations rather than individual cells. The discussion brings to light issues at the heart of designing complex living systems and provides a trajectory for future development. © 2006 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {The bilateral symmetry of the mouse embryo is broken by leftward fluid flow in the node. However, it is unclear how this directional flow is then translated into the robust, left side-specific Nodal gene expression that determines and coordinates left-right situs throughout the embryo. While manipulating Nodal and Lefty gene expression, we have observed phenomena that are indicative of the involvement of a self-enhancement and lateral-inhibition (SELI) system. We constructed a mathematical SELI model that not only simulates, but also predicts, experimental data. As predicted by the model, Nodal expression initiates even on the right side. These results indicate that directional flow represents an initial small difference between the left and right sides of the embryo, but is insufficient to determine embryonic situs. Nodal and Lefty are deployed as a SELI system required to amplify this initial bias and convert it into robust asymmetry. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In addition, the Hill equation was the first (and is the simplest) quantitative receptor model in pharmacology. Although the Hill equation is an empirical receptor model (its parameters have only physico-chemical meaning for a simple ligand binding reaction), it requires only minor a priori knowledge about the mechanism of action for the investigated agonist to reliably fit concentration-response curve data and to yield useful results (in contrast to most of the advanced receptor models). Thus, the Hill equation has remained an important tool for physiological and pharmacological investigations including drug discovery, moreover it serves as a theoretical basis for the development of new pharmacological models. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We have isolated the revTetR G96E L205S mutant, which, contrary to TetR, binds tetO only in the presence of atc. This reverse acting mutant was overproduced and purified. Effector and DNA binding properties were analyzed by EMSA and quantified by fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance. The association constant KA of revTetR for binding of [atcMg]+ is ∼108 M-1, four orders of magnitude lower than that of TetR. The affinity of TetR for tetO is 5.6 ± 2 × 109 M-1 and that for revTetR in the presence of atc is 1 ± 0.2 × 108 M-1. Both induced forms, the atc-bound TetR and the free revTetR, have the same low affinity of 4 ± 1 × 105 M-1 for DNA. Therefore, atc does not act as a dimerization agent for revTetR.

Regardless of their specific molecular interactions, the majority of these mechanisms require morphogen gradients as the spatial cue, which are either predefined or generated as a part of the patterning process. However, using Escherichia coli programmed by a synthetic gene circuit, we demonstrate here the generation of robust, self-organized ring patterns of gene expression in the absence of an apparent morphogen gradient. Instead of being a spatial cue, the morphogen serves as a timing cue to trigger the formation and maintenance of the ring patterns. The timing mechanism enables the system to sense the domain size of the environment and generate patterns that scale accordingly. Our work defines a novel mechanism of pattern formation that has implications for understanding natural developmental processes.},

This behaviour is now called anti-phase synchronization. This paper presents an analysis of the behaviour of a large class of coupled identical oscillators, including Huygens’ clocks, using methods of equivariant bifurcation theory. The equivariant normal form for such systems is developed and the possible solutions are characterized. The transformation of the physical system parameters to the normal form parameters is given explicitly and applied to the physical values appropriate for Huygens’ clocks, and to those of more recent studies. It is shown that Huygens’ physical system could only exhibit anti-phase motion, explaining why Huygens observed exclusively this. By contrast, some more recent researchers have observed in-phase or other more complicated motion in their own experimental systems. Here, it is explained which physical characteristics of these systems allow for the existence of these other types of stable solutions. The present analysis not only accounts for these previously observed solutions in a unified framework, but also introduces behaviour not classified by other authors, such as a synchronized toroidal breather and a chaotic toroidal breather.},

   abstract = {Synchronization among arrays of beating cilia is one of the emergent phenomena in biological processes at meso-scopic scales. Strong inter-ciliary couplings modify the natural beating frequencies, ω, of individual cilia to produce a collective motion that moves around a group frequency ωm. Here we study the thermodynamic cost of synchronizing cilia arrays by mapping their dynamics onto a generic phase oscillator model. The model suggests that upon synchronization the mean heat dissipation rate is decomposed into two contributions, dissipation from each cilium's own natural driving force and dissipation arising from the interaction with other cilia, the latter of which can be interpreted as the one produced by a potential with a time-dependent protocol in the framework of our model. The spontaneous phase-synchronization of beating dynamics of cilia induced by strong inter-ciliary coupling is always accompanied with a significant reduction of dissipation for the cilia population, suggesting that organisms as a whole expend less energy by attaining a temporal order. At the level of individual cilia, however, a population of cilia with jωj < ωm expend more amount of energy upon synchronization.},

Since the observations by Gray and Rothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, it has been a working hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between beating filaments. Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of flagella isolated from the multicellular alga Volvox has shown that hydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony. However, the situation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella. We show that flagella of Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in filamentary connections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization from the wild type. We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella and conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional flagellar coupling. In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16 flagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the flagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar actuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling and hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of flagellar coordination in unicellular algae.},

Despite extensive measurements of TFs' dissociation constant (Kd) in vitro, their apparent Kdin vivo are usually unknown. LacI, a bacterial TF, is often used to artificially recruit proteins onto eukaryotic genomes. As LacI binds tightly to its recognition site (LacO) in vitro with a Kd about 10 picomolar (pM), it is often assumed that LacI also has high affinity to LacO in vivo. In this work, we measured LacI binding in living yeast cells using a fluorescent repressor operator system and found an apparent Kd of ∼0.6 μM, four orders of magnitude higher than that in vitro. By genetically altering (i) GFP-LacI structure, (ii) GFP-LacI stability, (iii) chromosome accessibility and (iv) LacO sequence, we reduced the apparent Kd to <10 nM. It turns out that the GFP tagging location and the fusion protein stability have a large effect on LacI binding, but surprisingly, chromosome accessibility only plays a mild role. These findings contribute to our quantitative understanding of the features that affect the apparent Kd of TF in cells. They also provide guidance for future design of more specific chromosomal recruitment through high-affinity TFs.},

The function of OL was verified by mutational analysis. Binding was found to be specific and cooperative. Multimeric forms of the repressor were observed, thus indicating that the repressor may bind simultaneously to all three operator sites. Inverted repeats with homology to the operator sites of TP901-1 were identified in phage genomes encoding repressors homologous to CI of TP901-1. Interestingly, the locations of these repeats on the phage genomes correspond to those found in TP901-1, indicating that the same system of cooperative repression of early phage promoters has been inherited by modular evolution. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

   abstract = {The universally recognized kinetic model of colony growth, introduced by Pirt, predicts a linear increase of colony size. The linearity follows from the assumption that the colony expands through the growth of only such cells that are located immediately behind the moving colony front, in the so-called peripheral zone of constant width and density. In this work, Pirt's model was tested on two bacteria-Alcaligenes sp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens-having markedly distinct cultural properties and grown on agarized medium with pyruvate. The colony size dynamics was followed for different densities of the inoculum, ranging from a single cell to a microdroplet of bacterial suspension (105-106 cells), and for different depths of the agar layer, determining the amount of available substrate. A linear growth mode was observed only with P. fluorescens and only in the case of growth from a microdroplet. When originating from a single cell, colonies of both organisms displayed nonlinear growth with a distinct peak of Kr (the rate of colony radius increase) occurring after 2-3 days of growth. The growth of P. fluorescens colonies showed virtually no dependence on the depth of the agarized medium, whereas the rate of colony size increase of Alcaligenes sp. turned out to be directly related to the medium layer thickness. The departure from linearity is consistently explained by a new kinetic chart stipulating a possible contribution to the colony growth not only of peripheral cells but also (much more distinct in Alcaligenes) of cells at the colony center. The colony growth dynamics is determined not only by the concentration of the limiting substrate but also by the amount of autoinhibitor, the synthesis of which is governed by age of cells. The distinctions of growth from a single cell and microdroplet could also originate as a result of dissociation into the R- and S-forms and competition between the corresponding subpopulations for oxygen and the common substrate.},

   abstract = {The enormous diversity among bacterial colonies of different species, and among colonies of the same species under different environmental conditions, has long interested microbiologists. Yet it is only comparatively recently that quantitative, rather than merely conceptual, models have been developed to explain the dynamics of bacterial colony formation and growth. Understanding the fundamental processes that drive these dynamics is still at a rudimentary level, though a number of advances have been made. This review traces the history of bacterial colony growth modelling, from the pioneering work of Pirt in the late 1960s, through experimental investigations by Wimpenny and his colleagues in the 1970s, and further models extending from that work to understand complex bacterial colony formations. It concludes with recent results which find that both diameter and height of the colony follow simple power-law behaviour over the entire active growth period (from a few hours to several days old), and that the results of Pirt, Wimpenny and their contemporaries can be re-interpreted. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We correct the model to formally include a feature crucial of the ring generation mechanism: a bacterial density threshold to the nonlinear diffusivity of the MKK model. We numerically integrate the model equations, and observe the logarithmic profiles of the bacterial densities near the front. These lead us to define a consolidation front distinct from the colony radius. We find that this consolidation front propagates outward toward the colony radius with a nearly constant velocity. We then implement the corrected MKK equations in two dimensions and compare our results with biological experiment. Our numerical results indicate that the two-dimensional corrected MKK model yields smooth (rather than branched) rings, and that colliding colonies merge if grown in phase but not if grown out of phase. We also introduce a model, based on coupling the MKK model to a nutrient field, for simulating experimentally observed branched rings. © 2001 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {A diffusively driven instability has been hypothesized as a mechanism to drive spatial self-organization in biological systems since the seminal work of Turing. Such systems are often considered on a growing domain, but traditional theoretical studies have only treated the domain size as a bifurcation parameter, neglecting the system non-autonomy. More recently, the conditions for a diffusively driven instability on a growing domain have been determined under stringent conditions, including slow growth, a restriction on the temporal interval over which the prospect of an instability can be considered and a neglect of the impact that time evolution has on the stability properties of the homogeneous reference state from which heterogeneity emerges. Here, we firstly relax this latter assumption and observe that the conditions for the Turing instability are much more complex and depend on the history of the system in general. We proceed to relax all the above constraints, making analytical progress by focusing on specific examples. With faster growth, instabilities can grow transiently and decay, making the prediction of a prospective Turing instability much more difficult. In addition, arbitrarily high spatial frequencies can destabilize, in which case the continuum approximation is predicted to break down.},

We observe three distinct growth modes for the Turing patterns, which also depend on the radial growth rate.

By numerical investigations, we find that the emergent patterns may be characterized by dominant network modes when the homogeneous equilibrium becomes unstable. These dominant network modes on duplex networks are related to the most unstable network modes in monolayer networks. Using these dominant networks modes, we develop approximation methods to deal with the instability of the homogeneous equilibrium on duplex networks. The comparison between theoretical and numerical results suggests that the approximation methods may serve as a tool for analyzing patterns on duplex networks.},

   abstract = {Growth of an organism involves transformations of the state of matter from unstructured food or photosynthate into the highly organized matter in the living organism. Biological evolution involves random changes in the structure of DNA that lead to changes in the organization of the matter in an organism. Thermodynamic data show the organized biomass in living organisms has the same thermodynamic properties as a random mixture of the same elemental composition and is not in an energetically metastable, low entropy state. Therefore, the central thesis of this work is that building biological structures and organization from foodstuffs incurs no direct thermodynamic cost. The implication is that growth and evolution occur with little or no thermodynamic cost. In consequence, the fundamental difference between living biomass and lifeless organic sludge is in the information constraints that direct and govern the organization of the system. These constraints within a living organism override random processes to produce an organized distribution of biomass within the organism. Similarly, the information in DNA constrains the outcome of biological evolution across organisms within a population of a species in a predictable way that leads to convergent evolution. Although individuals and molecules act or are acted upon in a random manner, the outcome in a constrained system is predictable within an organism and across organisms. As a consequence evolution will produce similar outcomes at the macro level in similar environments. Stochastic determinism is proposed as a method that could be used to model convergent evolution.},

However, the number of different mechanisms that may exist for cells to interpret morphogens, and the importance of design features such as feedback or local cell-cell communication, is unclear. A complete understanding of such systems will require going beyond a case-by-case analysis of real morphogen interpretation mechanisms and mapping out a complete GRN 'design space.' Here, we generate a first atlas of design space for GRNs capable of patterning a homogeneous field of cells into discrete gene expression domains by interpreting a fixed morphogen gradient. We uncover multiple very distinct mechanisms distributed discretely across the atlas, thereby expanding the repertoire of morphogen interpretation network motifs. Analyzing this diverse collection of mechanisms also allows us to predict that local cell-cell communication will rarely be responsible for the basic dose-dependent response of morphogen interpretation networks. © 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.

FGF signalling controls somite boundary position and regulates segmentation clock control of spatiotemporal Hox gene activation. Cell 106, 219-232). Dynamic expression of FGF8 in the presomitic mesoderm constitutes the wavefront of determination which sweeps along the body axis interacting as it moves with the segmentation clock to gate cells into somites. We also show that the model can mimic the anomalies formed when progression of the wavefront is disturbed and make some experimental predictions that can be used to test the hypotheses underlying the model. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Both mathematical theories and experimental observations have invoked a "clock and wavefront" model to explain this phenomenon, in which long-range molecular gradients control the movement of the front and therefore the placement of the stripes in the embryo. Here, we develop a fundamentally different model - a progressive oscillatory reaction-diffusion (PORD) system driven by short-range interactions. In this model, posterior movement of the front is a local, emergent phenomenon that, in contrast to the clock and wavefront model, is not controlled by global positional information. The PORD model explains important features of somitogenesis, such as size regulation, that previous reaction-diffusion models could not explain. Moreover, the PORD and clock and wavefront models make different predictions about the results of FGF-inhibition and tissue-cutting experiments, and we demonstrate that the results of these experiments favor the PORD model.},

   abstract = {The currently accepted interpretation of the clock and wavefront model of somitogenesis is that a posteriorly moving molecular gradient sequentially slows the rate of clock oscillations, resulting in a spatial readout of temporal oscillations. However, while molecular components of the clocks and wavefronts have now been identified in the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM), there is not yet conclusive evidence demonstrating that the observed molecular wavefronts act to slow clock oscillations. Here we present an alternative formulation of the clock and wavefront model in which oscillator coupling, already known to play a key role in oscillator synchronisation, plays a fundamentally important role in the slowing of oscillations along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Our model has three parameters which can be determined, in any given species, by the measurement of three quantities: the clock period in the posterior PSM, somite length and the length of the PSM. A travelling wavefront, which slows oscillations along the AP axis, is an emergent feature of the model. Using the model we predict: (a) the distance between moving stripes of gene expression; (b) the number of moving stripes of gene expression and (c) the oscillator period profile along the AP axis. Predictions regarding the stripe data are verified using existing zebrafish data. We simulate a range of experimental perturbations and demonstrate how the model can be used to unambiguously define a reference frame along the AP axis. Comparing data from zebrafish, chick, mouse and snake, we demonstrate that: (a) variation in patterning profiles is accounted for by a single nondimensional parameter; the ratio of coupling strengths; and (b) the period profile along the AP axis is conserved across species. Thus the model is consistent with the idea that, although the genes involved in pattern propagation in the PSM vary, there is a conserved patterning mechanism across species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Most current models for morphogenesis of repeated patterns, such as vertebrate somites, cannot explain the observed degree of constancy for the number of somites in individuals of a given species. This precision requires a mechanism whereby the lengths of someites (i.e. number of cells per somite) must adjust to the overall size of individual embryos, and one which co-ordinates numbers of somites with position in the whole pattern of body parts. A qualitative model is presented that does admit the observed precision. It is also compatible with experimental observations such as the sequential formation of somites from anterior to posterior in a regular time sequence, the timing of cellular change during development generally, and the increasing evidence for widespread existence of cellular biorhythms. The model involves an interacting "clock" and "wavefront". The clock is is asmooth cellular oscillator, for which cells throughout the embryo are assumed to be phase-linked. The wavefront is a front of rapid cell change moving slowly down the long axis of the embryo; cells enter a phase of rapid alteration in locomotory and/or adhesive properties at successively later times according to anterior-posterior body position. In the model, the smooth intracellular oscillator itself interacts with the possibility of the rapid primary change or its transmission within cells, thereby gating rhythmically the slow progress of the wavefront. Cells thus enter their rapid change of properties in a succession of separate populations, creating the pattern. It is argued that the elements, a smooth oscillator, a slow wavefront and a rapid cellular change, have biological plausibility. The consequences of combining them were suggested by catastrophe theory. We stress the necessary relation between the present model and the more general concept of positional information (Wolpert, 1969, 1971). Prospective and ongoing experiments stimulated by the model are discussed, and emphasis is placed on how such conceptions of morphogenesis can help reval homology between organisms having developments that are very different to a surface inspection. © 1976.},

Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate.

We obtain general conditions for the onset and structure of diffusion driven instabilities in reaction–diffusion systems on domains which evolve in time, in terms of the time-evolution of the Laplace–Beltrami spectrum for the domain and functions which specify the domain evolution. Our results give sufficient conditions for diffusive instabilities phrased in terms of differential inequalities which are both versatile and straightforward to implement, despite the generality of the studied problem. These conditions generalize a large number of results known in the literature, such as the algebraic inequalities commonly used as a sufficient criterion for the Turing instability on static domains, and approximate asymptotic results valid for specific types of growth, or specific domains. We demonstrate our general Turing conditions on a variety of domains with different evolution laws, and in particular show how insight can be gained even when the domain changes rapidly in time, or when the homogeneous state is oscillatory, such as in the case of Turing–Hopf instabilities. Extensions to higher-order spatial systems are also included as a way of demonstrating the generality of the approach.},

A drawback of these and other small molecule inducers is the difficulty of their removal from cell cultures, limiting their application for dynamic control. Here, we describe a simple method to overcome this limitation, and show that the natural photosensitivity of aTc/Tc can be exploited to turn them into highly predictable optogenetic transcriptional- and growth-regulators. This new optogenetic class uniquely features both dynamic and setpoint control which act via population-memory adjustable through opto-chemical modulation. We demonstrate this method by applying it for dynamic gene expression control and for enhancing the performance of an existing optogenetic system. We then expand the utility of the aTc system by constructing a new chemical bandpass filter that increases its aTc response range. The simplicity of our method enables scientists and biotechnologists to use their existing systems employing aTc/Tc for dynamic optogenetic experiments without genetic modification.},

According to this model, somitogenesis is based upon the interaction between a genetic oscillator, known as segmentation clock, and a moving wavefront, which provides the positional information indicating where each pair of somites is formed. Recently, Cotterell et al. (2015) reported a conceptually different mathematical model for somitogenesis. The authors called it a progressive oscillatory reaction-diffusion (PORD) model. In this model, somitogenesis is driven by short-range interactions and the posterior movement of the front is a local, emergent phenomenon, which is not controlled by global positional information. With the PORD model, it was possible to explain some experimental observations that are incompatible with the clock and wavefront model. However the PORD model has the disadvantage of being quite sensitive to fluctuations. In this work, we propose a modified version of the PORD model in order to overcome this and others inconveniences. By means of numerical simulations and a numerical stability analysis, we demonstrate that the modified PORD model achieves the robustness characteristic of somitogenesis, when the effect of the wavefront is included.},

The Mesolens enabled the discovery of intra-colony channels on the order of 10 μm in diameter, that are integral to E. coli macro-colony biofilms and form as an emergent property of biofilm growth. These channels have a characteristic structure and re-form after total mechanical disaggregation of the colony. We demonstrate that the channels are able to transport particles and play a role in the acquisition of and distribution of nutrients through the biofilm. These channels potentially offer a new route for the delivery of dispersal agents for antimicrobial drugs to biofilms, ultimately lowering their impact on public health and industry.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is regulated by many enzymes, including the recently discovered mitochondria pyruvate carrier, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate carboxylase, to modulate overall pyruvate carbon flux. Mutations in any of the genes encoding for proteins regulating pyruvate metabolism may lead to disease. Numerous cases have been described.

Then, we present a rigorous procedure for calculating the normal form associated with the Turing-Hopf bifurcation of PDEs. We show that the reduced dynamics associated with Turing-Hopf bifurcation is exactly the dynamics of codimension-two ordinary differential equations (ODE), which implies the ODE techniques can be employed to classify the reduced dynamics by the unfolding parameters. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to an autocatalysis model governed by reaction-diffusion equations; for such model, the dynamics in the neighbourhood of this bifurcation point can be divided into six categories, each of which is exactly demonstrated by the numerical simulations; and then according to this dynamical classification, a stable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution has been found.},

Turing proposed in his pioneering work different activator-inhibitor systems with different diffusion rates, which could trigger the emergence of such cell structures. Mathematically, one describes these activator-inhibitor systems as a coupled systems of reaction-diffusion equations with hugely different diffusion coefficients and highly nonlinear interaction. One famous example of these systems is the Gierer-Meinhardt system. These systems usually are not of monotone type, such that one has to apply other techniques. The purpose of this article is to study the stochastic reaction-diffusion Gierer-Meinhardt system with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on a one or two-dimensional bounded spatial domain.

Unlike previous studies of this nature, the choice of the heterogeneous distributions of the parameters is closely linked and estimated by use of rigorous wave mode selection in order to excite different modes in different subsets of the domains. This allows us to relate the numerical solutions with theoretical linear stability analytical results. Our most revealing results show that the wave modes of adjacent subsets evolve locally and yet possess continuity across the interface. These local patches of the solutions result in a globally heterogeneous solution stable only in the presence of heterogeneous distributions of the parameters. Furthermore, our results show that initial conditions continue to play a crucial role in the selection of excitable wave modes and consequently the formation of the inhomogeneous patterns formed. In particular, initial conditions influence pattern orientation and polarity, and yet with a prepattern, the patterns conserved orientation and polarity. Numerical solutions are obtained by the use of the finite element method and the backward Euler scheme to deal with the spatial and the time discretisations, respectively.},

   abstract = {We previously showed that the adult ocellated lizard skin colour pattern is effectively generated by a stochastic cellular automaton (CA) of skin scales. We additionally suggested that the canonical continuous 2D reaction-diffusion (RD) process of colour pattern development is transformed into this discrete CA by reduced diffusion coefficients at the borders of scales (justified by the corresponding thinning of the skin). Here, we use RD numerical simulations in 3D on realistic lizard skin geometries and demonstrate that skin thickness variation on its own is sufficient to cause scale-by-scale coloration and CA dynamics during RD patterning. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is robust to RD model variation. Finally, using dimensionality-reduction approaches on large networks of skin scales, we show that animal growth affects the scale-colour flipping dynamics by causing a substantial decrease of the relative length scale of the labyrinthine colour pattern of the lizard skin.},

Using stability analysis, we receive the significant specifications for Turing instability (diffusive-driven instability), and with the help of these conditions, recognize the corresponding realm in the region of interest. Moreover, we present a qualitative analysis of growth and development actions that involves species distribution and their interplay of the spatially distributed populace with diffusion and obtain the conditions for spatial patterns like spots, spot-stripe, and stripes. Using weakly nonlinear analysis, we derive the equations of amplitude for slow modulation near the Turing boundary. By the series of numerical simulations, we receive intricate spatial patterns, particularly spot, stripe, and spot-stripe in the Turing realm. The consequences of this paper are general in the real world and can be used to investigate the impact of self-diffusion on other predator–prey systems.

However, the small number and lack of movement of chromatophores defies traditional Turing-type pattern generating mechanisms. Recent models invoke discrete short-range competition and long-range promotion between different pigment cells as an alternative to a reaction-diffusion scheme. In this work, we propose a lattice-based “Survival model,” which is inspired by recent experimental findings on the nature of long-range chromatophore interactions. The Survival model produces stationary patterns with diffuse stripes and undergoes a Turing instability. We also examine the effect that domain growth, ubiquitous in biological systems, has on the patterns in both the Survival model and an earlier “Promotion” model. In both cases, domain growth alone is capable of orienting Turing patterns above a threshold wavelength and can reorient the stripes in ablated cells, though the wavelength for which the patterns orient is much larger for the Survival model. While the Survival model is a simplified representation of the multifaceted interactions between pigment cells, it reveals complex organizational behavior and may help to guide future studies.},

   abstract = {Multi-cellular modelling, where tissues and organs are represented by a collection of individual interacting agents, is a well established field, encapsulating several different approaches. In particular, off-lattice models, which represent cells using points that are free to move in space, have been applied to numerous biological problems in both two and three dimensions. The fact that a cell can be represented by point objects is useful in a wide range of settings, particularly when large populations are involved. However, a purely point-based representation is not naturally equipped to deal with objects that inherently have length like cell boundaries or external membranes. In this paper we introduce a novel off-lattice modelling framework that exploits rigid body mechanics to represent cells using a collection of one-dimensional edges (rather than zero-dimensional points) in a viscosity-dominated system. The rigid body framework can be used, among other things, to represent cells as free moving polygons, to allow epithelial layers to smoothly interact with themselves, and to model rod shaped cells like bacteria. We demonstrate the value of our new framework by using it in these three applications, showing that this approach can replicate established results, as well as offer solutions to problems that limit the scope of current off-lattice multi-cellular models. Main Multi-cellular modelling is a technique for representing tissues as a collection of individual agents. It can be used to investigate anything from embryogenesis [7] to crypt homeostasis [31]. The agents can be represented by objects on a fixed lattice, or by an "off-lattice" approach using points that are free to move in space. In 1981, Odell et al. [22] demonstrated the ability of off-lattice approaches to investigate morphogenesis caused by the mechanics of cell-cell interactions. Since then they have been used in a vast array of modelling problems and developed into several unique branches. Among them are centre based models where a cell is represented by a single point (for instance, overlapping spheres [9] and tessellation models [16]), and multi-node models (like the vertex model [20], the sub-cellular element method [21], and the immersed boundary method [27]) where cells are represented by a collection of points. These methods, in a broad sense, are built in a "node-based" framework, since they all calculate motion from interactions between nodes.},

The homogeneous state corresponding to the stable stationary state of an individual local element of the system may lose its stability because of diffusive coupling between spatially separated points. However, a situation is possible such that both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous (large amplitude) states are stable (bistability, despite the fact that the local system has the only stationary state).

Conversely, if the corresponding well-mixed system is sufficiently close to a coalescence point of Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations (two eigenvalues are zero at such a point), and if the spatial domain is sufficiently large, then there exists a nearly scalar diffusion matrix such that a Turing instability occurs. These results imply that information on bifurcation loci from experiments in continuous-flow stirred tank reactor suffices to locate regions of parameter space where Turing instabilities are likely to occur; no knowledge of the reaction mechanism and rate constants is needed. In order to illustrate these results, we have analyzed a six-step model of the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction due to Showalter, Noyes, and Bar-Eli. In this model, the sixth step describes the reduction of the metal ion catalyst by the organic substrate.

Here, we explore schemes for programmable pattern formation within a theoretical framework, in which subunits process local signals to update their discrete state following logical rules. We study systems with different update rules, topologies, and control schemes, assessing their capability of programmable pattern formation and their susceptibility to errors. Only a fraction permits local organizers to dictate any target pattern, by transcribing temporal patterns into spatial patterns, reminiscent of the principle underlying vertebrate somitogenesis. An alternative scheme employing variable rules cannot reach all patterns but is insensitive to the timing of organizer inputs.

The hrpL promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like AND integration behaviour. The AND gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a NOT gate module to produce a combinatorial NAND gate.

We have deciphered the inducer recognition mechanism of two AraC/XylS regulators from Pseudomonas putida (BenR and XylS) for creating a novel expression system responsive to acetyl salicylate (i.e., aspirin). Using protein homology modeling and molecular docking with the cognate inducer benzoate and a suite of chemical analogues, we identified the conserved binding pocket of BenR and XylS. By means of site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a single amino acid position required for efficient inducer recognition and transcriptional activation. Whereas this modification in BenR abolishes protein activity, in XylS, it increases the response to several inducers, including acetyl salicylic acid, to levels close to those achieved by the canonical inducer. Moreover, by constructing chimeric proteins with swapped N-terminal domains, we created novel regulators with mixed promoter and inducer recognition profiles. As a result, a collection of engineered TFs was generated with an enhanced response to benzoate, 3-methylbenzoate, 2-methylbenzoate, 4-methylbenzoate, salicylic acid, aspirin, and acetylsalicylic acid molecules for eliciting gene expression in E. coli.},

   abstract = {Multicellular entities are characterized by intricate spatial patterns, intimately related to the functions they perform. These patterns are often created from isotropic embryonic structures, without external information cues guiding the symmetry breaking process. Mature biological structures also display characteristic scales with repeating distributions of signals or chemical species across space. Many candidate patterning modules have been used to explain processes during development and typically include a set of interacting and diffusing chemicals or agents known as morphogens. Great effort has been put forward to better understand the conditions in which pattern-forming processes can occur in the biological domain. However, evidence and practical knowledge allowing us to engineer symmetry-breaking is still lacking. Here we follow a different approach by designing a synthetic gene circuit in E. coli that implements a local activation long-range inhibition mechanism. The synthetic gene network implements an artificial differentiation process that changes the physicochemical properties of the agents. Using both experimental results and modeling, we show that the proposed system is capable of symmetry-breaking leading to regular spatial patterns during colony growth. Studying how these patterns emerge is fundamental to further our understanding of the evolution of biocomplexity and the role played by self-organization. The artificial system studied here and the engineering perspective on embryogenic processes can help validate developmental theories and identify universal properties underpinning biological pattern formation, with special interest for the area of synthetic developmental biology.},

   abstract = {Controllable spatial patterning is a major goal for the engineering of biological systems. Recently, synthetic gene circuits have become promising tools to achieve the goal; however, they need to possess both functional robustness and tunability in order to facilitate future applications. Here we show that, by harnessing the dual signaling and antibiotic features of nisin, simple synthetic circuits can direct Lactococcus lactis populations to form programmed spatial band-pass structures that do not require fine-tuning and are robust against environmental and cellular context perturbations. Although robust, the patterns are highly tunable, with their band widths specified by the external nisin gradient and cellular nisin immunity. Additionally, the circuits can direct cells to consistently generate designed patterns, even when the gradient is driven by structured nisin-producing bacteria and the patterning cells are composed of multiple species. A mathematical model successfully reproduces all of the observed patterns. Furthermore, the circuits allow us to establish predictable structures of synthetic communities and controllable arrays of cellular stripes and spots in space. This study offers new synthetic biology tools to program spatial structures. It also demonstrates that a deep mining of natural functionalities of living systems is a valuable route to build circuit robustness and tunability.},

Specifically, receiver bacteria collectively interact with sender bacteria for decision-making through quorum sensing. Input patterns formed by chemical inducers activate senders to produce signaling molecules at varying levels. These levels, which act as weights, are programmed by tuning the sender promoter strength Furthermore, a gradient descent based algorithm that enables weights optimization was developed.

We present a synthetic biology framework to understand and characterize the spatiotemporal patterning properties of the toggle switch. To this end, we built a synthetic toggle switch controllable by diffusible molecules in Escherichia coli . We analyzed the patterning capabilities of the circuit by combining quantitative measurements with a mathematical reconstruction of the underlying dynamical system.

This tunable interplay of self-communication and neighbor communication enables cells to span a diverse repertoire of cellular behaviors. These include a cell being asocial by responding only to itself and social through quorum sensing, and an isogenic population of cells splitting into social and asocial subpopulations.

Here, we examined scaling in engineered Escherichia coli that can form self-organized core-ring patterns in colonies. We found that the ring width exhibits perfect scale invariance to the colony size. Our analysis revealed a collective space-sensing mechanism, which entails sequential actions of an integral feedback loop and an incoherent feedforward loop. The integral feedback is implemented by the accumulation of a diffusive chemical produced by a colony. This accumulation, combined with nutrient consumption, sets the timing for ring initiation. The incoherent feedforward is implemented by the opposing effects of the domain size on the rate and duration of ring maturation. This mechanism emphasizes a role of timing control in achieving robust pattern scaling and provides a new perspective in examining the phenomenon in natural systems.},

Natural quorum-sensing systems provide components for cell communication, but their use is often constrained by signal crosstalk. We have established new orthogonal systems for cell-cell communication using acyl homoserine lactone signaling systems. Quantitative measurements in contexts of differing receiver protein expression allowed us to separate different types of crosstalk between 3-oxo-C6- and 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactones, cognate receiver proteins, and DNA promoters. Mutating promoter sequences minimized interactions with heterologous receiver proteins. We used experimental data to parameterize a computational model for signal crosstalk and to estimate the effect of receiver protein levels on signal crosstalk. We used this model to predict optimal expression levels for receiver proteins, to create an effective two-channel cell communication device. Establishment of a novel spatial assay allowed measurement of interactions between geometrically constrained cell populations via these diffusible signals. We built relay devices capable of long-range signal propagation mediated by cycles of signal induction, communication and response by discrete cell populations. This work demonstrates the ability to systematically reduce crosstalk within intercellular signaling systems and to use these systems to engineer complex spatiotemporal patterning in cell populations.},

   abstract = {Periodic patterning is widespread in development and can be modelled by reaction-diffusion (RD) processes. However, minimal two-component RD descriptions are vastly simpler than the multi-molecular events that actually occur and are often hard to relate to real interactions measured experimentally. Addressing these issues, we investigated the periodic striped patterning of the rugae (transverse ridges) in the mammalian oral palate, focusing on multiple previously implicated pathways: FGF, Hh, Wnt and BMP. For each, we experimentally identified spatial patterns of activity and distinct responses of the system to inhibition. Through numerical and analytical approaches, we were able to constrain substantially the number of network structures consistent with the data. Determination of the dynamics of pattern appearance further revealed its initiation by 'activators' FGF and Wnt, and 'inhibitor' Hh, whereas BMP and mesenchyme-specific-FGF signalling were incorporated once stripes were formed. This further limited the number of possible networks. Experimental constraint thus limited the number of possible minimal networks to 154, just 0.004% of the number of possible diffusion-driven instability networks. Together, these studies articulate the principles of multi-morphogen RD patterning and demonstrate the utility of perturbation analysis for constraining RD systems.

Each cell performs a simple computational operation, but when combined with cellg-cell communication, intricate patterns emerge. Here we study this process by combining a simple genetic circuit with quorum sensing to produce more complex computations in space. We construct a simple NOR logic gate in Escherichia coli by arranging two tandem promoters that function as inputs to drive the transcription of a repressor. The repressor inactivates a promoter that serves as the output. Individual colonies of E. coli carry the same NOR gate, but the inputs and outputs are wired to different orthogonal quorum-sensing 'receiver' devices. The quorum molecules form the wires between gates. By arranging the colonies in different spatial configurations, all possible two-input gates are produced, including the difficult XOR and EQUALS functions. The response is strong and robust, with 5-to >300-fold changes between the 'on' and 'off' states.

In this review, we examine both a rational and a combinatorial design of such networks and discuss progress on using in vitro evolution techniques to obtain functional systems. Moving beyond pure transcription networks, more and more networks are being implemented at the level of RNA, taking advantage of mechanisms of translational control and aptamer-small molecule complex formation. Unlike gene expression systems, metabolic components are generally not as interconnectable in any combination, and so engineering of metabolic circuits is a particularly challenging field. Nonetheless, metabolic engineering has immense potential to provide useful biosynthesis tools for biotechnology applications. Finally, although prokaryotes are mostly studied as single cell systems, cell-cell communication networks are now being developed that result in spatial pattern formation in multicellular prokaryote colonies. This represents a crossover with multicellular organisms, showing that prokaryotic systems have the potential to tackle questions traditionally associated with developmental biology.

A new approach to problems of self-organization and turbulence is developed, treating these phenomena as a result of spontaneous formation and subsequent evolution of autosolitons. Scenarios of self-organization involve sophisticated interactions between autosolitons, whereas turbulence is regarded as a pattern of autosolitons which appear and disappear at random in different parts of the system. This is the first monograph to provide a comprehensive summary of the theory of autosolitons as developed by the authors over many years of research.

This hydrogen ion autoactivated reaction is the only example known to produce sustained stationary lamellar patterns and a wealth of other spatio-temporal phenomena including self-replication and localized oscillatory domain of spots, due to repulsive front interactions and to a parity-breaking front bifurcation (nonequilibrium Ising-Bloch bifurcation). We show experimentally that the space scale separation necessary for the observation of stationary patterns is mediated by the presence of low mobility weak acid functional groups. The presence of such groups was overlooked in the original observations made with hydrolyzable polyacrylamide gels. This missing information made the original observations difficult to reproduce and frustrated further experimental exploitation of the fantastic potentialities of this system. Using one-side-fed spatial reactors filled with agarose gel, we can reproduce all the previous pattern observations, in particular the stationary labyrinthine patterns, by introducing, above a critical concentration, well controlled amounts of polyacrylate chains in the gel network. We use two different geometries of spatial reactors (annular and disk shapes) to provide complementary information on the actual three-dimensional character of spatial patterns. We also reinvestigate the role of other feed parameters and show that the system exhibits both a domain of spatial bistability and of large-amplitude pH oscillations associated in a typical cross-shape diagram. The experimental method presented here can be adapted to produce patterns in the large number of oscillatory and bistable reactions, since the iodate-sulfite-ferrocynide reaction is a prototype of these systems. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Crosstalk is a major challenge to engineering sophisticated synthetic gene networks. A common approach is to insulate signal-transduction pathways by minimizing molecular-level crosstalk between endogenous and synthetic genetic components, but this strategy can be difficult to apply in the context of complex, natural gene networks and unknown interactions. Here, we show that synthetic gene networks can be engineered to compensate for crosstalk by integrating pathway signals, rather than by pathway insulation. We demonstrate this principle using reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive gene circuits in Escherichia coli that exhibit concentration-dependent crosstalk with non-cognate ROS. We quantitatively map the degree of crosstalk and design gene circuits that introduce compensatory crosstalk at the gene network level. The resulting gene network exhibits reduced crosstalk in the sensing of the two different ROS. Our results suggest that simple network motifs that compensate for pathway crosstalk can be used by biological networks to accurately interpret environmental signals.},

Here, we report the development of a new biosynthetic pathway for the production of AA from glucose in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli through the β-alanine (BA) route. The AA production pathway was partitioned into two modules: an AA forming downstream pathway and a BA forming upstream pathway. We first validated the operation of the downstream pathway in vitro and in vivo, and then constructed the downstream pathway by introducing efficient enzymes (Act, Acl2, and YciA) screened out of various microbial sources and optimizing the expression levels. For the direct fermentative production of AA from glucose, the downstream pathway was introduced into the BA producing E. coli strain. The resulting strain could successfully produce AA from glucose in flask cultivation. AA production was further enhanced by expressing the upstream genes (panD and aspA) under the constitutive BBa_J23100 promoter. Replacement of the native promoter of the acs gene with the BBa_J23100 promoter in the genome increased AA production to 55.7 mg/L in flask. Fed-batch fermentation of the final engineered strain allowed production of 237 mg/L of AA in 57.5 h, representing the highest AA titer reported to date.},

It typically involves cell-cell communication and intracellular signal processing. Here we show a synthetic multicellular system in which genetically engineered 'receiver' cells are programmed to form ring-like patterns of differentiation based on chemical gradients of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal that is synthesized by 'sender' cells. In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes and may foster applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial fabrication and biosensing.},

   abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

This process, commonly known as quorum sensing, aids in the regulation of genes crucial for the survival of species within heterogeneous populations of microbes. Although signal exchange was studied extensively in well-mixed environments, less is known about the consequences of crosstalk in spatially distributed mixtures of species. Here, signaling dynamics were measured in a spatially distributed system containing multiple strains utilizing homologous signaling systems. Crosstalk between strains containing the lux, las and rhl AHL-receptor circuits was quantified. In a distributed population of microbes, the impact of community composition on spatio-temporal dynamics was characterized and compared to simulation results using a modified reaction-diffusion model. After introducing a single term to account for crosstalk between each pair of signals, the model was able to reproduce the activation patterns observed in experiments. We quantified the robustness of signal propagation in the presence of interacting signals, finding that signaling dynamics are largely robust to interference. The ability of several wild isolates to participate in AHL-mediated signaling was investigated, revealing distinct signatures of crosstalk for each species. Our results present a route to characterize crosstalk between species and predict systems-level signaling dynamics in multispecies communities.},

In the context of a very generic model of ecological pattern formation, we show that the inclusion of intrinsic noise in Turing models leads to the formation of " quasipatterns" that form in generic regions of parameter space and are experimentally distinguishable from standard Turing patterns. The existence of quasipatterns removes the need for unphysical fine tuning or separation of scales in the application of Turing models to real systems. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

Crosstalk, where a single HSL can activate multiple regulators, can lead to faults in networks composed of parallel signaling pathways. Here, we report an investigation of quorum sensing components to identify synthetic pathways that exhibit little to no crosstalk in liquid and solid cultures. In previous work, we characterized the response of a single regulator (LuxR) to 10 distinct HSL-synthase enzymes. Our current study determined the responses of five different regulators (LuxR, LasR, TraR, BjaR, and AubR) to the same set of synthases. We identified two sets of orthogonal synthase-regulator pairs (BjaI/BjaR + EsaI/TraR and LasI/LasR + EsaI/TraR) that show little to no crosstalk when they are expressed in Escherichia coli BL21.

   abstract = {Efficient lignin valorization could add more than 10-fold the value gained from burning it for energy and is critical for economic viability of future biorefineries. However, lignin-derived aromatics from biomass pretreatment are known to be potent fermentation inhibitors in microbial production of fuels and other value-added chemicals. In addition, isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and other inducers are routinely added into fermentation broth to induce the expression of pathway enzymes, which further adds to the overall process cost. An autoregulatory system that can diminish the aromatics' toxicity as well as be substrate-inducible can be the key for successful integration of lignin valorization into future lignocellulosic biorefineries. Toward that goal, in this study an autoregulatory system is demonstrated that alleviates the toxicity issue and eliminates the cost of an external inducer. Specifically, this system is composed of a catechol biosynthesis pathway coexpressed with an active aromatic transporter CouP under induction by a vanillin self-inducible promoter, ADH7, to effectively convert the ligninderived aromatics into value-added chemicals using Escherichia coli as a host. The constructed autoregulatory system can efficiently transport vanillin across the cell membrane and convert it to catechol. Compared with the system without CouP expression, the expression of catechol biosynthesis pathway with transporter CouP significantly improved the catechol yields about 30% and 40% under promoter pTrc and ADH7, respectively. This study demonstrated an aromaticinduced autoregulatory system that enabled conversion of ligninderived aromatics into catechol without the addition of any costly, external inducers, providing a promising and economically viable route for lignin valorization.},

Pathway optimization by incorporation of efficient enzymes for each step and host strain engineering by knocking out competing pathways enabled 1.27 g/L 3,4-DHBA produced in shake flasks, which is the highest titer reported so far.

   abstract = {To understand the mechanisms of ectoine-induced osmoprotection in Sinorhizobium meliloti, a proteomic examination of S. meliloti cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with ectoine was undertaken. This revealed the induction of 10 proteins. The protein products of eight genes were identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass specirometry. Five of these genes, with four other genes whose products were not detected on two-dimensional gels, belong to the same gene cluster, which is localized on the pSymB megaplasmid. Four of the nine genes encode the characteristic components of an ATP-binding cassette transporter that was named ehu, for ectoine/hydroxyectoine uptake. This transporter was encoded by four genes (ehuA, ehuB, ehuC, and ehuD) that formed an operon with another gene cluster that contains five genes, named eutABCDE for ectoine utilization. On the basis of sequence homologies, eutABCDE encode enzymes with putative and hypothetical functions in ectoine catabolism. Analysis of the properties of ehuA and eutA mutants suggests that S. meliloti possesses at least one additional ectoine catabolic pathway as well as a lower-affinity transport system for ectoine and hydroxyectoine. The expression of ehuB, as determined by measurements of UidA activity, was shown to be induced by ectoine and hydroxyectoine but not by glycine betaine or by high osmolality.

   abstract = {Bacteria frequently adapt to high osmolarity surroundings through the accumulation of compatible solutes. Ectoine is a prominent member of these types of stress protectants and is produced via an evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic pathway beginning with the L-2,4-diaminobutyrate (DAB) transaminase (TA) EctB. Here, we studied EctB from the thermo-tolerant Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus lautus (Pl) and show that this tetrameric enzyme is highly tolerant to salt, pH, and temperature. During ectoine biosynthesis, EctB converts L-glutamate and L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde into 2-oxoglutarate and DAB, but it also catalyzes the reverse reaction. Our analysis unravels that EctB enzymes are mechanistically identical to the PLP-dependent gamma-aminobutyrate TAs (GABA-TAs) and only differ with respect to substrate binding. Inspection of the genomic context of the ectB gene in P. lautus identifies an unusual arrangement of juxtapositioned genes for ectoine biosynthesis and import via an Ehu-type binding-protein-dependent ABC transporter. This operon-like structure suggests the operation of a highly coordinated system for ectoine synthesis and import to maintain physiologically adequate cellular ectoine pools under osmotic stress conditions in a resource-efficient manner. Taken together, our study provides an in-depth mechanistic and physiological description of EctB, the first enzyme of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway.},

We demonstrate that mexAB-oprM and pmeR are expressed in vivo at a relatively high and moderate basal level, respectively, which, in both cases, increases in the presence of different flavonoids and other compounds, such as butyl and methylparaben. We show that PmeR is the local repressor of the mexABoprM promoter and is able to regulate its own expression. The mechanism for this regulation includes binding to a pseudopalindromic operator site which overlaps both mexAB-oprM and pmeR promoters. We have also proven that flavonoids are able to interact with PmeR and induce a conformational change that interferes with the DNA binding ability of PmeR, thereby modulating mexAB-oprM and pmeR expression. Finally, we demonstrate by in vivo experiments that the PmeR/MexAB-OprM system contributes to the colonization of tomato plants. These results provide new insight into a transcriptional regulator and a transport system that play essential roles in the ability of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 to resist the action of flavonoids produced by the host. © 2011 The American Phytopathological Society.},

The DAPG biosynthetic locus harbors the phlG gene, the function of which has not been elucidated thus far. The phlG gene is located upstream of the phlACBD biosynthetic operon, between the phlF and phlH genes which encode pathway-specific regulators. In this study, we assigned a function to PhlG as a hydrolase specifically degrades DAPG to equimolar amounts of mildly toxic monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG) and acetate. DAPG added to cultures of a DAPG-negative ΔphlA mutant of strain CHA0 was completely degraded, and MAPG was temporarily accumulated. In contrast, DAPG was not degraded in cultures of a ΔphlA ΔphlG double mutant. To confirm the enzymatic nature of PhlG in vitro, the protein was histidine tagged, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by affinity chromatography. Purified PhlG had a molecular mass of about 40 kDa and catalyzed the degradation of DAPG to MAPG. The enzyme had a kcat of 33 s-1 and a Km of 140 μM at 30°C and pH 7. The PhlG enzyme did not degrade other compounds with structures similar to DAPG, such as MAPG and triacetylphloroglucinol, suggesting strict substrate specificity. Interestingly, PhlG activity was strongly reduced by pyoluteorin, a further antifungal compound produced by the bacterium. Expression of phlG was not influenced by the substrate DAPG or the degradation product MAPG but was subject to positive control by the GacS/GacA two-component system and to negative control by the pathway-specific regulators PhlF and PhlH.

   abstract = {Many species of Proteobacteria produce acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) compounds as quorum-sensing (QS) signals for cell density-dependent gene regulation. Most known AHL synthases, LuxI-type enzymes, produce fatty AHLs, and the fatty acid moiety is derived from an acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis. Recently, a class of LuxI homologs has been shown to use CoA-linked aromatic or amino acid substrates for AHL synthesis. By using an informatics approach, we found the CoA class of LuxI homologs exists primarily in α-Proteobacteria. The genome of Prosthecomicrobium hirschii, a dimorphic prosthecate bacterium, possesses a luxI-like AHL synthase gene that we predicted to encode a CoA-utilizing enzyme. We show the P. hirschii LuxI homolog catalyzes synthesis of phenylacetyl-homoserine lactone (PA-HSL). Our experiments show P. hirschii obtains phenylacetate from its environment and uses a CoA ligase to produce the phenylacetyl-CoA substrate for the LuxI homolog. By using an AHL degrading enzyme, we showed that PA-HSL controls aggregation, biofilm formation, and pigment production in P. hirschii. These findings advance a limited understanding of the CoA-dependent AHL synthases. We describe how to identify putative members of the class, we describe a signal synthesized by using an environmental aromatic acid, and we identify phenotypes controlled by the aryl-HSL.},

Two nodD homologues, nodD1 and nodD2, are present in the Rhizobium galegae strain HAMBI 1174. In this work we analysed their ability to induce the nodA promoter with synthetic inducers known to activate nod genes in other rhizobia. According to phylogenetic analysis, the inducer-specific carboxy-terminal part of the R. galegae nodD protein sequence groups together with those of Rhizobium leguminosarum and Sinorhizobium meliloti. However, the respective inducer compounds for their NodD proteins are not highly effective with R. galegae nodD products. The best inducer discovered with R. galegae nodD1 was the root exudate of the host plant of R. galegae, Galega orientalis. HPLC analyses revealed the presence of many divergent flavonoid compounds in the G. orientalis root exudate. The most effective HPLC fractions induced R. galegae nodD1 up to the level obtained by intact G. orientalis root exudate while apigenin and luteolin, which were also present in the root exudate, were only moderate inducers. A UV-Vis diode array spectrum of the most active peak indicated that the main inducer present in the G. orientalis root exudate is an unidentified chalcone-type compound. In the Galega-R. galegae interaction the first recognition between the NodD protein and the flavonoid inducer secreted from the roots of Galega is specific for these organisms, and thus partly responsible of the strict host specificity of this symbiosis. © 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Here, we address this limitation by developing a generic genome-wide approach to identify transcription factor-based inducible gene expression systems. We construct and validate 15 functional biosensors, provide a characterisation workflow to facilitate forward engineering efforts, exemplify their broad-host-range applicability, and demonstrate their utility in enzyme screening. Previously uncharacterised interactions between sensors and compounds of biological relevance are identified by employing the largest reported library of metabolite-responsive biosensors in an automated high-throughput screen.

   abstract = {NodD1 is a member of the NodD family of LysR-type transcriptional regulators that mediates the expression of nodulation (nod) genes in the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. Each species of rhizobia establishes a symbiosis with a limited set of leguminous plants. This host specificity results in part from a NodD-dependent upregulation of nod genes in response to a cocktail of flavoeoids in the host plant's root exudates. To demonstrate that NodD is a key determinant of host specificity, we expressed nodD genes from different species of rhizobia in a strain of S. meliloti lacking endogenous NodD activity. We observed that nod gene expression was initiated in response to distinct sets of flavonoid inducers depending on the source of NodD. To better understand the effects of flavonoids on NodD, we assayed the DNA binding activity of S. meliloti NodD1 treated with the flavonoid inducer luteolin. In the presence of luteolin, NodD1 exhibited increased binding to nod gene promoters compared to binding in the absence of luteolin. Surprisingly, although they do not stimulate nod gene expression in S. meliloti, the flavonoids naringenin, eriodictyol, and daidzein also stimulated an increase in the DNA binding affinity of NodD1 to nod gene promoters. In vivo competition assays demonstrate that noninducing flavonoids act as competitive inhibitors of luteolin, suggesting that both inducing and noninducing flavonoids are able to directly bind to NodD1 and mediate conformational changes at nod gene promoters but that only luteolin is capable of promoting the downstream changes necessary for nod gene induction.

Two strategies were evaluated for the development of chimeric LysR-type biosensors with customized ligand specificity profiles toward three closely related flavonoids, naringenin, apigenin, and luteolin. In the first strategy, chimeric promoter regions were constructed at the biosensor effector module, while in the second strategy, chimeric transcription factors were created at the biosensor detector module. Via both strategies, the biosensor repertoire was expanded with luteolin-specific chimeric biosensors demonstrating a variety of response curves and ligand specificity profiles. Starting from the nonspecific biosensor chassis, a shift from 27.5% to 95.3% luteolin specificity was achieved with the created chimeric biosensors. Both strategies provide a compelling, faster, and more accessible route for the customization of biosensor ligand specificity, compared to de novo design and construction of each biosensor circuit for every desired ligand specificity.},

The dioxygenase system appears to be encoded by three genes, benABC, whose products, 53-, 19-, and 38-kilodalton proteins, correspond in size to those of components in other bacterial dioxygenases. The cloned dioxygenase system is expressed at high level in E. coli, enabling the conversion of benzoate to a cis-diol, 2-hydro-1,2-dihydroxybenzoate, at a rate comparable to that of fully induced A. calcoaceticus cultures. A cis-diol dehydrogenase, the product of the A. calcoaceticus benD gene, when present in E. coli enables this organism to convert the cis-diol intermediate to catechol. The dehydrogenase has been partially purified and is a dimer with two identical 31-kilodalton subunits. The ben genes are clustered on the A. calcoaceticus chromosome with independently regulated genes needed for the dissimilation of catechol. In a 16-kilobase-pair region of the chromosome there are 10 genes for benzoate catabolism, organized in no fewer than three transcriptional units.

Bacteria confer resistance to inhibitors of NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the amidated NAD salvage pathway, in cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, a microbial nicotinamidase (PncA) that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a precursor in the alternative deamidated NAD salvage pathway, is necessary and sufficient for this protective effect. Using stable isotope tracing and microbiota-depleted mice, we demonstrate that this bacteria-mediated deamidation contributes substantially to the NAD-boosting effect of oral nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside supplementation in several tissues.

   abstract = {Background: Recently, the compatible solute 1, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid (ectoine) has attracted considerable interest due to its great potential as a protecting agent. To overcome the drawbacks of high salinity in the traditional bioprocess of ectoine using halophilic bacteria, various attempts have been made to engineer ectoine biosynthesis in nonhalophilic bacteria. Unfortunately, the yields of ectoine in these producers are still low and hardly meet the demands of large scale production. In this paper, the whole-cell biocatalytic process using aspartate and glycerol as substrates was tried for high production of ectoine in nonhalophilic bacteria. Results: The ectoine genes ectABC from the halophilic bacterium Halomonas elongata were successfully introduced into Escherichia coli K-12 strain BW25113 under the arabinose-inducible promoter. To our delight, a large amount of ectoine was synthesized and excreted into the medium during the course of whole-cell biocatalysis, when using aspartate and glycerol as the direct substrates. At the low cell density of 5 OD/mL in flask, under the optimal conditions (100mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.0), 100mM sodium aspartate, 100mM KCl and 100mM glycerol), the concentration of extracellular ectoine was increased to 2.67mg/mL. At the high cell density of 20 OD/mL in fermentor, a maximum titre of 25.1g/L ectoine was achieved in 24h. Meanwhile, the biomass productivity of ectoine is as high as 4048mg per gram dry cell weight (g DCW)<sup>-1</sup>, which is the highest value ever reported. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the same batch of cells could be used for at least three rounds. Finally, a total yield of 63.4g ectoine was obtained using one litre cells. Conclusion: Using aspartate and glycerol as the direct substrates, high production of ectoine was achieved by the whole-cell biocatalysis in recombinant E. coli. Multiple rounds of whole-cell biocatalysis were established to further improve the production of ectoine. Our study herein provided a feasible biosynthesis process of ectoine with potential applications in large-scale industrial production.},

   abstract = {cis,cis-Muconic acid (MA) is a valuable C6 dicarboxylic acid platform chemical that is used as a starting material for the production of various valuable polymers and drugs, including adipic acid and terephthalic acid. As an alternative to traditional chemical processes, bio-based MA production has progressed to the establishment of de novo MA pathways in several microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Pseudomonas putida, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Redesign of the metabolic pathway, intermediate flux control, and culture process optimization were all pursued to maximize the microbial MA production yield. Recently, MA production from biomass, such as the aromatic polymer lignin, has also attracted attention from researchers focusing on microbes that are tolerant to aromatic compounds. This paper summarizes recent microbial MA production strategies that involve engineering the metabolic pathway genes as well as the heterologous expression of some foreign genes involved in MA biosynthesis. Microbial MA production will continue to play a vital role in the field of bio-refineries and a feasible way to complement various petrochemical-based chemical processes.},

One such molecule is fisetin, which is present in many fruits and vegetables and has several potential health benefits, including anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-aging activity. Moreover, fisetin has recently been shown to prevent Alzheimer's disease in mice and to prevent complications associated with diabetes type I. Thus far the biosynthetic pathway of fisetin in plants remains elusive. Here, we present the heterologous assembly of a novel fisetin pathway in Escherichia coli. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway from the amino acid, tyrosine, utilizing nine heterologous enzymes. The pathway proceeds via the synthesis of two flavanones never produced in microorganisms before - garbanzol and resokaempferol. We show for the first time a functional biosynthetic pathway and establish E. coli as a microbial platform strain for the production of fisetin and related flavonols.},

We overproduced the nodA protein as a fusion product with a portion of the λ cI repressor in Escherichia coli. This fusion protein was purified from inclusion bodies by gel and hydroxyapatite chromatography in the presence of NaDodSO4. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies against the hybrid protein were used to detect the nodA protein in the cytosol of E. coli and R. meliloti by immunoblotting. In contrast to experiments with antibodies against the R. meliloti nodC membrane protein, the alfalfa-R. meliloti nodulation was not affected by the addition of anti-nodA antibodies to medium and inoculum. This suggests that the nodA protein is located within the cell and is therefore not accessible to antibodies. The expression of the nodA gene is induced in R. meliloti by various compounds present in the exudate of leguminous plants, particularly by the flavone luteolin. We show that the plant hormone trigonelline also has some inducing activity. The nodC protein was further localized in the membrane fraction of R. meliloti. Our experiments demonstrate that the nodC transmembrane protein is not necessary for the uptake of the compounds inducing the synthesis of the nodA protein. The nodA and the nodC proteins were also detected in mature nodules. During nodule development, the nodC protein may be processed to a 34-kDa protein.},

The QdoR-biosensor was successfully applied for detection of kaempferol production in vivo at the single cell level by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Furthermore, the amount of kaempferol produced highly correlated with the specific fluorescence of E. coli cells containing a flavonol synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (fls1).

Yet the screening of libraries of cellular designs to identify best-performing biocatalysts is most often a low-throughput endeavor. For this reason, the development of biosensors enabling real-time monitoring of production has attracted attention. Here we applied systematic engineering of multiple parameters to search for a general biosensor design in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on small-molecule binding transcriptional activators from the prokaryote superfamily of LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs). We identified a design supporting LTTR-dependent activation of reporter gene expression in the presence of cognate small-molecule inducers. As proof of principle, we applied the biosensors for in vivo screening of cells producing naringenin or cis,cis-muconic acid at different levels, and found that reporter gene output correlated with production. The transplantation of prokaryotic transcriptional activators into the eukaryotic chassis illustrates the potential of a hitherto untapped biosensor resource useful for biotechnological applications.},

A strain of Escherichia coli K-12, BW25113, was genetically modified, and a novel nonnative metabolic pathway was introduced for the synthesis of MA from glucose. The proposed pathway converted chorismate from the aromatic amino acid pathway to MA via 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHB). Three nonnative genes, pobA, aroY, and catA, coding for 4-hydroxybenzoate hydrolyase, protocatechuate decarboxylase, and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, respectively, were functionally expressed in E. coli to establish the MA biosynthetic pathway. E. coli native genes ubiC, aroFFBR, aroE, and aroL were overexpressed and the genes ptsH, ptsI, crr, and pykF were deleted from the E. coli genome in order to increase the precursors of the proposed MA pathway. The final engineered E. coli strain produced nearly 170 mg/liter of MA from simple carbon sources in shake flask experiments. The proposed pathway was proved to be functionally active, and the strategy can be used for future metabolic engineering efforts for production of MA from renewable sugars.},

In this work, we describe the de novo biosynthesis of two important flavones, apigenin and luteolin, and one known flavanone, eriodictyol. Their plant biosynthetic pathways have been reconstructed for heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus, an actinomycete bacterium manageable at industrial production level. Also, production levels for apigenin have been improved by feeding with naringenin precursor, and timing for settlement of secondary metabolism has been advanced by spore conditioning.

   abstract = {In Pseudomonas putida, the catBC operon encodes enzymes involved in benzoate degradation. Previous studies have determined that these enzymes are induced when P. putida is grown in the presence of benzoate. Induction of the enzymes of the catBC operon requires an intermediate of benzoate degradation, cis,cis-muconate, and a regulatory protein, CatR. It has been determined that CatR binds to a 27-bp region of the catBC promoter in the presence or absence of inducer. We have called this the repression binding site. In this study, we used a gel shift assay to demonstrate that the inducer, cis,cis-muconate, increases the affinity of CatR for the catBC promoter region by 20-fold. Furthermore, in the absence of cis,cis-muconate, CatR forms two complexes in the gel shift assay. The inducer cis,cis-muconate confers specificity primarily for the formation of complex 2. DNase I footprinting showed that an additional 27 bp of the catBC promoter region is protected by CatR in the presence of cis,cis-muconate. We have named this second binding site the activation binding site. Methylation interference footprinting determined that in the presence or absence of inducer, five G nucleotides of the catBC promoter region were necessary for CatR interaction with the repression binding site, while a single G residue was important for CatR interaction with the activation binding site in the presence of cis,cis-muconate. Using polymerase chain reaction-generated constructs, we found that the binding of CatR to the repression binding site is independent of the activation binding site. However, binding of CatR to the activation binding site required an intact repression binding site.},

The promoters were representative either of the enterobacterial σ70 (P phb, PacoE, and PpdhE)- or σ54 (PacoD and PacoX)-dependent promoters. To obtain polymers consisting of C4-C12 monomer units, an artificial operon consisting of the PHA synthase gene from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 (phaC1 Ps) tandemly linked to the W. eutropha genes encoding β-ketothiolase (phbA We) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dependent acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (phbB We) was constructed. All recombinant strains produced PHA, indicating that the PHA biosynthesis genes were expressed under the control of the different promoters. Cell growth and PHA synthesis on MS medium complemented with gluconate or octanoate, and different concentrations of acetoin (0, 0.15, and 0.3%) clearly differed among the recombinant strains. While the PacoD and P acoX promoters mediated only low PHA yields (<1%) in the presence of the inducer acetoin, the remaining promoters-independent of the addition of acetoin-resulted in the production of PHA polymers with high 3HB fractions (90-100 mol%) and with high 3HO contents (70-86 mol%) from gluconate and octanoate, respectively. Interestingly, on octanoate-MS medium with 0.15% acetoin, the PacoE promoter mediated the synthesis of PHA with a relatively high 3HB fraction (48 mol%). While PHAs with high 3HB contents were obtained, the overall PHA product yields were low (<10%); thus, their potential application for further commercial exploitation appears limited. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Acetoin can be reused by the bacteria during stationary phase when other carbon sources have been depleted. The acoABCL operon encodes the E1α, E1β, E2, and E3 subunits of the acetoin dehydrogenase complex in B. subtilis. Expression of this operon is induced by acetoin and repressed by glucose in the growth medium. The acoR gene is located downstream from the acoABCL operon and encodes a positive regulator which stimulates the transcription of the operon. The product of acoR has similarities to transcriptional activators of sigma 54-dependent promoters. The four genes of the operon are transcribed from a -12, -24 promoter, and transcription is abolished in acoR and sigL mutants. Deletion analysis showed that DNA sequences more than 85 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site are necessary for full induction of the operon. These upstream activating sequences are probably the targets of AcoR. Analysis of an acoR'-'lacZ strain of B. subtilis showed that the expression of acoR is not induced by acetoin and is repressed by the presence of glucose in the growth medium. Transcription of acoR is also negatively controlled by CcpA, a global regulator of carbon catabolite repression. A specific interaction of CcpA in the upstream region of acoR was demonstrated by DNase I footprinting experiments, suggesting that repression of transcription of acoR is mediated by the binding of CcpA to the promoter region of acoR.},

This yields large amounts of acids, causing strong and sometimes even lethal acidification of the environment. Other family members employ the 2,3-butanediol fermentation pathway, which generates comparatively less acidic and more neutral end products, such as acetoin and 2,3-butanediol. In this work, we equipped Escherichia coli MG1655 with the budAB operon, encoding the acetoin pathway, from Serratia plymuthica RVH1 and investigated how this affected the ability of E. coli to cope with acid stress during growth. Acetoin fermentation prevented lethal medium acidification by E. coli in lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with glucose. It also supported growth and higher stationary-phase cell densities in acidified LB broth with glucose (pH 4.10 to 4.50) and in tomato juice (pH 4.40 to 5.00) and reduced the minimal pH at which growth could be initiated. On the other hand, the acetoin-producing strain was outcompeted by the nonproducer in a mixed-culture experiment at low pH, suggesting a fitness cost associated with acetoin production. Finally, we showed that acetoin production profoundly changes the appearance of E. coli on several diagnostic culture media. Natural E. coli strains that have laterally acquired budAB genes may therefore have escaped detection thus far. This study demonstrates the potential importance of acetoin fermentation in the ecology of E. coli in the food chain and contributes to a better understanding of the microbiological stability and safety of acidic foods.},

NAD can be synthesized through the deamidated and amidated pathways, for which the key reaction involves adenylylation of nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), respectively. In Escherichia coli, NAD de novo biosynthesis depends on the protein NadD-catalyzed adenylylation of NaMN to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD), followed by NAD synthase-catalyzed amidation. In this study, we engineered NadD to favor NMN for improved amidated pathway activity. We designed NadD mutant libraries, screened by a malic enzyme-coupled colorimetric assay, and identified two variants, 11B4 (Y84V/Y118D) and 16D8 (A86W/Y118N), with a high preference for NMN. Whereas in the presence of NMN both variants were capable of enabling the viability of cells of E. coli BW25113-derived NADauxotrophic strain YJE003, for which the last step of the deamidated pathway is blocked, the 16D8 expression strain could grow without exogenous NMN and accumulated a higher cellular NAD(H) level than BW25113 in the stationary phase.

The acoABCL operon codes for the acetoin dehydrogenase complex, which is the major enzyme system responsible for the catabolism of acetoin in B. subtilis. Besides weak organic acids, the neutral overflow metabolite acetoin is metabolized by the cells in the early stationary phase. Transcription of reporter gene fusions with the acoA promoter of this operon is strongly repressed by glucose but induced by acetoin as soon as the preferred carbon source glucose is exhausted. The co-expression of an additional copy of the regulator gene acoR led to more than twofold higher activity of the acoA promoter. It is demonstrated that the induction of this promoter in growing cells with acetoin is possible with non-phosphotransferase system sugars as carbon and energy source and in a ccpA mutant background. Moreover, it could be shown that the activity of the acoA-directed expression system correlates with the level of acetoin in the medium. During glucose limitation, the utilization of the alternative energy source acetoin keeps the protein synthesis machinery of B. subtilis cells active and thus allows for a long lasting acoA-controlled expression of recombinant genes. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

The biosynthetic pathway of trigonelline is not fully elucidated. While it is quite likely that the production of trigonelline from nicotinate is catalyzed by N-methyltransferase, as is caffeine synthase (CS), the enzyme(s) and gene(s) involved in N-methylation have not yet been characterized. It should be noted that, similar to caffeine, trigonelline accumulation is initiated during the development of coffee fruits. Interestingly, the expression profiles for two genes homologous to caffeine synthases were similar to the accumulation profile of trigonelline. We presumed that these two CS-homologous genes encoded trigonelline synthases. These genes were then expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting recombinant enzymes that were obtained were characterized. Consequently, using the N-methyltransferase assay with S-adenosyl[methyl-14C]methionine, it was confirmed that these recombinant enzymes catalyzed the conversion of nicotinate to trigonelline, coffee trigonelline synthases (termed CTgS1 and CTgS2) were highly identical (over 95% identity) to each other. The sequence homology between the CTgSs and coffee CCS1 was 82%. The pH-dependent activity curve of CTgS1 and CTgS2 revealed optimum activity at pH 7.5. Nicotinate was the specific methyl acceptor for CTgSs, and no activity was detected with any other nicotinate derivatives, or with any of the typical substrates of B′-MTs. It was concluded that CTgSs have strict substrate specificity. The Km values of CTgS1 and CTgS2 were 121 and 184 μM with nicotinic acid as a substrate, and 68 and 120 μM with S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a substrate, respectively.},

Based on the chromosomal gene clustering analysis, we have identified a previously unknown gene encoding for kynurenine formamidase (EC 3.5.1.19) involved with the second step of the anthranilate pathway. This functional prediction was experimentally verified by cloning, expression and enzymatic characterization of recombinant kynurenine formamidase orthologs from Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia metallidurans. Experimental verification of the inferred anthranilate pathway was achieved by functional expression in Escherichia coli of the R. metallidurans putative kynBAU operon encoding three required enzymes: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (gene kynA), kynurenine formamidase (gene kynB), and kynureninase (gene kynU). Our data provide the first experimental evidence of the connection between these genes (only one of which, kynU, was previously characterized) and L-tryptophan aerobic degradation pathway in bacteria. © 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The soil-dwelling bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea natively produces erythromycin A from a 55 kb gene cluster composed of three large polyketide synthase genes (each ∼10 kb) and 17 additional genes responsible for deoxysugar biosynthesis, macrolide tailoring, and resistance. In this study, the erythromycin A gene cluster was systematically transferred from S. erythraea to E. coli for reconstituted biosynthesis, with titers reaching 10 mg/l. Polyketide biosynthesis was then modified to allow the production of two erythromycin analogs. Success establishes E. coli as a viable option for the heterologous production of erythromycin A and more broadly as a platform for the directed production of erythromycin analogs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Itaconate (methylenesuccinate) was recently identified as a mammalian metabolite whose production is substantially induced during macrophage activation. This compound is a potent inhibitor of isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, which is a pathway required for the survival of many pathogens inside the eukaryotic host. Here we show that numerous bacteria, notably many pathogens such as Yersinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have three genes for itaconate degradation. They encode itaconate coenzyme A (CoA) transferase, itaconyl-CoA hydratase and (S)-citramalyl-CoA lyase, formerly referred to as CitE-like protein. These genes are known to be crucial for survival of some pathogens in macrophages. The corresponding enzymes convert itaconate into the cellular building blocks pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, thus enabling the bacteria to metabolize itaconate and survive in macrophages. The itaconate degradation and detoxification pathways of Yersinia and Pseudomonas are the result of convergent evolution. This work revealed a common persistence factor operating in many pathogenic bacteria. © 2014 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

A number of microorganisms have been developed for the biosynthesis of itaconate including Aspergillus terreus, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the number of strains and conditions that can be tested for increased itaconate titers are currently limited because of the lack of high-throughput screening methods. Here we identified itaconate-inducible promoters and their corresponding LysR-type transcriptional regulators from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that the YpItcR/Pccl inducible system is highly inducible by itaconic acid in the model gammaproteobacterium E. coli and the betaproteobacterium Cupriavidus necator (215- and 105-fold, respectively). The kinetics and dynamics of the YpItcR/Pccl inducible system are investigated, and we demonstrate, that in addition to itaconate, the genetically encoded biosensor is capable of detecting mesaconate, cis-, and trans-aconitate in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the fluorescence-based biosensor is applied in E. coli to identify the optimum expression level of cadA, the product of which catalyzes the conversion of cis-aconitate into itaconate. The fluorescence output is shown to correlate well with itaconate concentrations quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet spectroscopy. This work highlights the potential of the YpItcR/Pccl inducible system to be applied as a biosensor for high-throughput microbial strain development to facilitate improved itaconate biosynthesis.},

   abstract = {Background: Mandelic acid (MA), an important component in pharmaceutical syntheses, is currently produced exclusively via petrochemical processes. Growing concerns over the environment and fossil energy costs have inspired a quest to develop alternative routes to MA using renewable resources. Herein we report the first direct route to optically pure MA from glucose via genetic modification of the L-phenylalanine pathway in E. coli.Results: The introduction of hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from Amycolatopsis orientalis into E. coli led to a yield of 0.092 g/L S-MA. By combined deletion of competing pathways, further optimization of S-MA production was achieved, and the yield reached 0.74 g/L within 24 h. To produce R-MA, hydroxymandelate oxidase (Hmo) from Streptomyces coelicolor and D-mandelate dehydrogenase (DMD) from Rhodotorula graminis were co-expressed in an S-MA-producing strain, and the resulting strain was capable of producing 0.68 g/L R-MA. Finally, phenylpyruvate feeding experiments suggest that HmaS is a potential bottleneck to further improvement in yields.Conclusions: We have constructed E. coli strains that successfully accomplished the production of S- and R-MA directly from glucose. Our work provides the first example of the completely fermentative production of S- and R-MA from renewable feedstock. © 2011 Sun et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Expression of cad in E. coli grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium without glucose in a test tube resulted in 0.07 g/L itaconic acid production after 78 h at 20<sup>0</sup>C. To increase itaconic acid production, E. coli recombinants were constructed by inactivating the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (icd) and/or the isocitrate lyase gene (aceA). Expression of cad and inactivation of icd resulted in 0.35 g/L itaconic acid production after 78 h, whereas aceA inactivation had no effect on itaconic acid production. The intracellular itaconate concentration in the ����icd strain was higher than that in the cad-expressing strain without icd inactivation, which suggests that the xtracellular secretion of itaconate in E. coli is the rate-determining step during itaconic acid production. pH-stat cultivation using the cad-expressing Δicd strain in LB medium with 3% glucose in a jar fermenter resulted in 1.71 g/L itaconic acid production after 97 h at 28<sup>0</sup>C. To further increase itaconic acid production, the aconitase B gene (acnB) was overexpressed in the cad-expressing Δicd strain. Simultaneous overexpression of acnB with the expression of cad in the Δicd strain led to 4.34 g/L itaconic acid production after 105 h. Our findings indicate that icd inactivation and acnB overexpression considerably enhance itaconic acid production in cad-expressing E. coli.},

Homologues of Pirin are highly conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their function remains poorly understood. We present here the crystal structure of the yhhW gene product, a putative Pirin homologue, from Escherichia coli and confirm its structural similarity to Pirin. The YhhW protein displays a bicupin fold with a single N-terminal metal coordination site. Molecular surface comparisons of YhhW and Pirin with structurally similar proteins suggested quercetin as a potential ligand. We demonstrate that both bacterial and human Pirins have quercetinase activity, which is inhibited by the addition of typical inhibitors of the quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase reaction. We also demonstrate the release of carbon monoxide as a reaction product. This is the first report of enzymatic activity for any member of the Pirin family and may be an important connection to their roles in transcriptional regulation. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

In both tissues, pattern formation is dependent on molecular gradients that emanate from opposite poles. Despite distinct evolutionary origins and differences in time scales, cell biology and molecular players, both tissues exhibit striking similarities in the regulatory systems that establish gene expression patterns that foreshadow the arrangement of cell types. First, signaling gradients establish initial conditions that polarize the tissue, but there is no strict correspondence between specific morphogen thresholds and boundary positions. Second, gradients initiate transcriptional networks that integrate broadly distributed activators and localized repressors to generate patterns of gene expression. Third, the correct positioning of boundaries depends on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the transcriptional networks. These similarities reveal design principles that are likely to be broadly applicable to morphogen-patterned tissues.},

In some cases, the sugar moiety attached to the flavonoid modulates its biological activities. Flavonoid glycones are not easily synthesized chemically. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to synthesize quercetin 3-O-glucosyl (1→2) xyloside and quercetin 3-O-glucosyl (1→6) rhamnoside (also called rutin) using two uridine diphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in Escherichia coli. To synthesize quercetin 3-O-glucosyl (1→2) xyloside, sequential glycosylation was carried out by regulating the expression time of the two UGTs. AtUGT78D2 was subcloned into a vector controlled by a Tac promoter without a lacI operator, while AtUGT79B1 was subcloned into a vector controlled by a T7 promoter. UDP-xyloside was supplied by concomitantly expressing UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (ugd) and UDP-xyloside synthase (UXS) in the E. coli. Using these strategies, 65.0 mg/L of quercetin 3-O-glucosyl (1→2) xyloside was produced. For the synthesis of rutin, one UGT (BcGT1) was integrated into the E. coli chromosome and the other UGT (Fg2) was expressed in a plasmid along with RHM2 (rhamnose synthase gene 2). After optimization of the initial cell concentration and incubation temperature, 119.8 mg/L of rutin was produced. The strategies used in this study thus show promise for the synthesis of flavonoid diglucosides in E. coli.},

Biotechnological production of these nutraceuticals, for example via heterologous biosynthesis in industrial actinomycetes, is favored since in plants these polyphenols appear as inactive glycosylated derivatives, in low concentrations or as part of complex mixtures with other polyphenolic compounds.

Sustainable production of such compounds is therefore of pronounced interest to biotechnologists in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. Here, we used a sugar O-methyltransferase enzyme from a spinosyn biosynthesis gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora spinosa to regioselectively produce chrysoeriol (15% conversion of luteolin; 30 µM) in a microbial host. The biosynthesized chrysoeriol was structurally characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry and various nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Moreover, the molecule was investigated against 17 superbugs, including thirteen Gram-positive and four Gram-negative pathogens, for anti-microbial effects. Chrysoeriol exhibited antimicrobial activity against nine pathogens in a disc diffusion assay at the concentration of 40 µg per disc. It has minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 1.25 µg/mL against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3640 (MRSA) for which the parent luteolin has an MIC value of sixteen-fold higher concentration (i.e., 20 µg/mL). Similarly, chrysoeriol showed better anti-microbial activity (~1.7-fold lower MIC value) than luteolin against Proteus hauseri, a Gram-negative pathogen. In contrast, a luteolin 40-O-methylated derivative, diosmetin, did not exhibit any anti-microbial activities against any tested pathogen.},

   abstract = {Trigonelline (TG; N-methylnicotinate) is a ubiquitous osmolyte. Although it is known that it can be degraded, the enzymes and metabolites have not been described so far. In this work, we challenged the laboratory model soil-borne, gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (ADP1) for its ability to grow on TG and we identified a cluster of catabolic, transporter, and regulatory genes. We dissected the pathway to the level of enzymes and metabolites, and proceeded to in vitro reconstruction of the complete pathway by six purified proteins. The four enzymatic steps that lead from TG to methylamine and succinate are described, and the structures of previously undescribed metabolites are provided. Unlike many aromatic compounds that undergo hydroxylation prior to ring cleavage, the first step of TG catabolism proceeds through direct cleavage of the C5–C6 bound, catalyzed by a flavin-dependent, two-component oxygenase, which yields (Z)-2-((N-methylformamido)methylene)-5-hydroxy-butyrolactone (MFMB). MFMB is then oxidized into (E)-2-((N-methylformamido) methylene) succinate (MFMS), which is split up by a hydrolase into carbon dioxide, methylamine, formic acid, and succinate semialdehyde (SSA). SSA eventually fuels up the TCA by means of an SSA dehydrogenase, assisted by a Conserved Hypothetical Protein. The cluster is conserved across marine, soil, and plant-associated bacteria. This emphasizes the role of TG as a ubiquitous nutrient for which an efficient microbial catabolic toolbox is available.},

The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by screening a gene library for hydrolase activity. The insert of a clone conferring phloretin hydrolase activity was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 822 bp (phy), a putative promoter region, and a terminating stem-loop structure. The deduced amino acid sequence of phy showed similarities to a putative protein of the 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthetic operon from Pseudomonas fluorescens. The phloretin hydrolase was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 55 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the deduced amino acid sequence of phy indicated molecular masses of 30 and 30.8 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the enzyme is a homodimer. The recombinant phloretin hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of phloretin to equimolar amounts of phloroglucinol and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. The optimal temperature and pH of the catalyzed reaction mixture were 37°C and 7.0, respectively. The Km for phloretin was 13 ± 3 μM and the Kcat was 10 ± 2 s-1.

Furthermore, acoA was inactivated in B. subtilis by disruptive mutagenesis; these mutants were impaired to express PP(i)-dependent AoDH E1 activity to remove acetoin from the medium and to grow with acetoin as the carbon source. Therefore, acetoin is catabolized in B. subtilis by the same mechanism as all other bacteria investigated so far, leaving the function of the previously described acu genes obscure.},

   abstract = {The engineering of genetic circuits with predictive functionality in living cells represents a defining focus of the expanding field of synthetic biology. This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.},

   abstract = {Current approaches for purifying plasmids from bacterial production systems exploit the physiochemical properties of nucleic acids in non-specific capture systems. In this study, an affinity system for plasmid DNA (pDNA) purification has been developed utilizing the interaction between the lac operon (lacO) sequence contained in the pDNA and a 64mer synthetic peptide representing the DNA-binding domain of the lac repressor protein, LacI. Two plasmids were evaluated, the native pUC19 and pUC19 with dual lacO3/lacOs operators (pUC19lacO3/lacOs), where the lacOs operator is perfectly symmetrical. The DNA-protein affinity interaction was evaluated by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore system. The affinity capture of DNA in a chromatography system was evaluated using LacI peptide that had been immobilized to Streamline™ adsorbent. The KD-values for double stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments containing lacO1 and lacO3 and lacOs and lacO3 were 5.7 ± 0.3 × 10 -11 M and 4.1 ± 0.2 × 10-11 M respectively, which compare favorably with literature reports of 5 × 10-10 - 1 × 10-9 M for native laCO1 and 1-1.2 × 10-10 M for lacO1 in a saline buffer. Densitometric analysis of the gel bands from the affinity chromatography run clearly showed a significant preference for capture of the supercoiled fraction from the feed pDNA sample. The results indicate the feasibility of the affinity approach for pDNA capture and purification using native protein-DNA interaction. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Events in normal animal development usually follow the sequence: patterning → differential gene expression → morphogenesis. A synthetic biological approach to development might follow a similar sequence, with each stage under the control of synthetic biological modules. The authors have constructed and published a synthetic module that drives self-organised patterning of mammalian cell populations into patches of different cell types. Here, as a proof of concept, they extend the self-patterning module with a morphogenetic effector that drives elective cell death in just one cell type. The result is a self-constructing pattern of two cell types, one of which can be selectively eliminated to leave remaining cells as a monolayer with a net-like structure. This simple device demonstrates and validates the idea of coupling synthetic biological morphogenetic effectors to synthetic biological patterning devices. It opens the path to engineering more sophisticated structures and, perhaps eventually, tissues.},

The timescale of such states in experimental systems is unclear: if they are long-lived, they can be harnessed by development or engineered in synthetic tissues. Here, we use experiments and computational modeling to demonstrate how such structures can be systematically designed by quantitative control of cell composition. By varying the number of highly adhesive and less adhesive cells in multicellular aggregates, we find the cell-type ratio and total cell count control pattern formation, with resulting structures maintained for several days. Our work takes a step toward mapping the design space of self-assembling structures in development and provides guidance to the emerging field of shape engineering with synthetic biology.},

The starvation-induced aggregation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum into a multicellular slug is known to result from single-cell chemotaxis towards emitted pulses of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient, short-range chemical gradients lead to coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we developed a multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe behaviors ranging widely from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of long-range cell—cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyzed cell—cell correlations, showing evidence of self-organization at the onset of aggregation (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell collectives, despite their finite size, show features of criticality known from phase transitions in physical systems. By comparing wild-type and mutant cells with impaired aggregation, we found the longest cell—cell communication distance in wild-type cells, suggesting that criticality provides an adaptive advantage and optimally sized aggregates for the dispersal of spores.},

   abstract = {The spatial relationships between molecules can be quantified in terms of information. In the case of membranes, the spatial organization of molecules in a bilayer is closely related to biophysically and biologically important properties. Here, we present an approach to computing spatial information based on Fourier coefficient distributions. The Fourier transform (FT) of an image contains a complete description of the image, and the values of the FT coefficients are uniquely associated with that image. For an image where the distribution of pixels is uncorrelated, the FT coefficients are normally distributed and uncorrelated. Further, the probability distribution for the FT coefficients of such an image can readily be obtained by Parseval's theorem. We take advantage of these properties to compute the spatial information in an image by determining the probability of each coefficient (both real and imaginary parts) in the FT, then using the Shannon formalism to calculate information. By using the probability distribution obtained from Parseval's theorem, an effective distance from the uncorrelated or most uncertain case is obtained. The resulting quantity is an information computed in k-space (kSI). This approach provides a robust, facile and highly flexible framework for quantifying spatial information in images and other types of data (of arbitrary dimensions). The kSI metric is tested on a 2D Ising model, frequently used as a model for lipid bilayer; and the temperature-dependent phase transition is accurately determined from the spatial information in configurations of the system. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Most of these systems comprise nonlinear reaction terms which makes it difficult to find closed form solutions. It therefore becomes convenient to look for numerical solutions: finite difference, finite element, finite volume and spectral methods are typical examples of the numerical methods used. Most of these methods are locally based schemes. We examine the implications of mesh structure on numerically computed solutions of a well-studied reaction-diffusion model system on two-dimensional fixed and growing domains. The incorporation of domain growth creates an additional parameter - the grid-point velocity - and this greatly influences the selection of certain symmetric solutions for the ADI finite difference scheme when a uniform square mesh structure is used. Domain growth coupled with grid-point velocity on a uniform square mesh stabilises certain patterns which are however very sensitive to any kind of perturbation in mesh structure. We compare our results to those obtained by use of finite elements on unstructured triangular elements. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The paper describes a model of competition that explains the formation of the ocular dominance stripes found in layer IVc of cat and monkey visual cortex. The main proposal is that synapses exert effects on the growth of other synapses, and that these effects extend over distances of at least 600 μm and vary in magnitude and sign within this distance. Interactions between like type synapses are assumed to be stimulating for distances up to about 200 μm, and inhibitory for distances of 200-600 μm. The reverse is true of interactions between synapses of opposite eye type, where the effects are inhibitory for distances up to about 200 μm and stimulating for longer ones. The interactions are assumed to be circularly symmetric. Growth of, for example, right eye synapses at one point will therefore (a) encourage local growth of right eye synapses and inhibit local growth of left eye synapses and (b) encourage growth of left eye synapses and inhibit growth of right eye synapses in an annular ring surrounding the point of initial increase. At the start of development, right and left eye synapses are assumed to be intermixed randomly within layer IVc. Computer simulations show that a wide variety of conditions incorporating these assumptions will lead to the formation stripe patterns. These reproduce many of the morphological features of monkey ocular dominance stripes, including Y- and H-type branches and terminations, the tendency for stripes to run at right angles into the boundaries of the pattern, and to narrow at branch points. The model can explain the effects of monocular deprivation on stripe morphology if it is assumed that the effectiveness of deprived eye synapses in determining rates of growth locally is reduced. The existence of a critical period for these effects can be explained if it is assumed that lateral growth of terminals does not occur, and that some factor such as a limited availability of postsynaptic sites decreases the rate of growth of synapses as their density approaches a maximum. The model can be generalized to account for pattern formation in other systems, such as zebra or mackerel skin, where similar striped patterns occur. In this context, the simplest model based on diffusion that will produce a pattern of stripes requires that one cell type should secrete two substances, one of which stimulates growth or differentiation of its parent cell type and has a low rate of diffusion or is rapidly inactivated, and another that inhibits growth or differentiation and either has a higher rate of diffusion or is less rapidly inactivated.},

B 237 (1952) 37) for the production of a broken spatial symmetry in an initially homogeneous system of reacting and diffusing substances has attracted much interest as a potential model for certain aspects of morphogenesis (Models of Biological Pattern Formation, Academic Press, London, 1982; Nature 376 (1995) 765) such as pre-patterning in the embryo. The two features necessary for the formation of Turing patterns are short-range autocatalysis and long-range inhibition (Kybernetik 12 (1972) 30) which usually only occur when the diffusion rate of the inhibitor is significantly greater than that of the activator. This observation has sometimes been used to cast doubt on applicability of the Turing mechanism to cellular patterning since many messenger molecules that diffuse between cells do so at more-or-less similar rates. Here we show that Turing-type patterns will be able to robustly form under a wide variety of realistic physiological conditions though plausible mechanisms of intra-cellular chemical communication without relying on differences in diffusion rates. In the mechanism we propose, reactions occur within cells. Signal transduction leads to the production of messenger molecules, which diffuse between cells at approximately equal rates, coupling the reactions occurring in different cells. These mechanisms also suggest how this process can be controlled in a rather precise way by the genetic machinery of the cell. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper we study the generalisation of the model to take into account inhibitory neurons. The resulting stochastic cellular automata are completely defined by five parameters: the number of excitatory neurons, N, the number of inhibitory neurons, M, the probabilities of excitation, α, and inhibition, γ, among neurons and the spontaneous transition rate from the firing to the quiescent state, β. We propose that the background of the electroencephalographic signals could be mimicked by the fluctuations in the total number of firing neurons in the excitatory subnetwork. These fluctuations are Gaussian and the mean-square displacement from an initial state displays a strongly subdiffusive behaviour approximately given by σ2 (t) = A (1 - e- t / τ), where N A = β / (β + M γ), τ = 2 (N α - β). Comparison with real EEG records exhibits good agreement with these predictions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We study a minimal, stochastic model of developmental patterns in Anabaena that includes a nondiffusing activator, two diffusing inhibitor morphogens, demographic fluctuations in the number of morphogen molecules, and filament growth. By tracking developing filaments, we provide experimental evidence for different spatiotemporal roles of the two inhibitors during pattern maintenance and for small molecular copy numbers, justifying a stochastic approach. In the deterministic limit, the model yields Turing patterns within a region of parameter space that shrinks markedly as the inhibitor diffusivities become equal. Transient, noise-driven, stochastic Turing patterns are produced outside this region, which can then be fixed by downstream genetic commitment pathways, dramatically enhancing the robustness of pattern formation, also in the biologically relevant situation in which the inhibitors' diffusivities may be comparable.},

Here we discuss how growth-rate dependence can be incorporated in mathematical models of gene expression by comparing data for unregulated genes with the predictions of different theoretical descriptions of growth-rate dependence.

In this paper we suggest a way for deriving asymptotic expansions to the limit cycle solutions due to a Hopf bifurcation in two-dimensional reaction systems and we use them to build convenient normal modes for the analysis of Turing instabilities of the limit cycle. They extend the Fourier modes for the steady state in the classical Turing approach, as they include time-periodic fluctuations induced by the limit cycle. Diffusive instabilities can be properly considered because of the non-catastrophic loss of stability that the steady state shows while the limit cycle appears. Moreover, we shall see that instabilities may appear even though the diffusion coefficients are equal. The obtained normal modes suggest that there are two possible ways, one weak and the other strong, in which the limit cycle generates oscillatory Turing instabilities near a Turing-Hopf bifurcation point. In the first case slight oscillations superpose over a dominant steady inhomogeneous pattern. In the second, the unstable modes show an intermittent switching between complementary spatial patterns, producing the effect known as twinkling patterns. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Instead, many models incorporate the cell cycle implicitly by assuming that dilution due to cell division can be described by an effective decay reaction with first-order kinetics. If it is further assumed that protein production occurs in bursts, then the stationary protein distribution is a negative binomial. Here we seek to understand how accurate these implicit models are when compared with more detailed models of stochastic gene expression. We derive the exact stationary solution of the chemical master equation describing bursty protein dynamics, binomial partitioning at mitosis, age-dependent transcription dynamics including replication, and random interdivision times sampled from Erlang or more general distributions; the solution is different for single lineage and population snapshot settings. We show that protein distributions are well approximated by the solution of implicit models (a negative binomial) when the mean number of mRNAs produced per cycle is low and the cell cycle length variability is large. When these conditions are not met, the distributions are either almost bimodal or else display very flat regions near the mode and cannot be described by implicit models. We also show that for genes with low transcription rates, the size of protein noise has a strong dependence on the replication time, it is almost independent of cell cycle variability for lineage measurements, and increases with cell cycle variability for population snapshot measurements. In contrast for large transcription rates, the size of protein noise is independent of replication time and increases with cell cycle variability for both lineage and population measurements.},

Here, we ask whether this diffusive threshold lowers for N>2 to allow "true"Turing instabilities. Inspired by May's analysis of the stability of random ecological communities, we analyze the probability distribution of the diffusive threshold in reaction-diffusion systems defined by random matrices describing linearized dynamics near a homogeneous fixed point. In the numerically tractable cases N≤6, we find that the diffusive threshold becomes more likely to be smaller and physical as N increases, and that most of these many-species instabilities cannot be described by reduced models with fewer diffusing species.},

Turing patterns constitute a main candidate to explain such processes, but they appear sensitive to fluctuations and variations in kinetic parameters, raising the question of how they may be adopted and realised in naturally evolved systems. The vast majority of mathematical studies of Turing patterns have used continuous models specified in terms of partial differential equations. Here, we complement this work by studying Turing patterns using discrete cellular automata models. We perform a large-scale study on all possible two-species networks and find the same Turing pattern producing networks as in the continuous framework. In contrast to continuous models, however, we find these Turing pattern topologies to be substantially more robust to changes in the parameters of the model. We also find that diffusion-driven instabilities are substantially weaker predictors for Turing patterns in our discrete modelling framework in comparison to the continuous case, in the sense that the presence of an instability does not guarantee a pattern emerging in simulations. We show that a more refined criterion constitutes a stronger predictor. The similarity of the results for the two modelling frameworks suggests a deeper underlying principle of Turing mechanisms in nature. Together with the larger robustness in the discrete case this suggests that Turing patterns may be more robust than previously thought.},

Turing patterning provides a foundational paradigm for understanding such systems. The simplest Turing systems are believed to require at least two morphogens to generate periodic patterns. Here, using mathematical modeling, we show that a simpler circuit, including only a single diffusible morphogen, is sufficient to generate long-range, spatially periodic patterns that propagate outward from transient initiating perturbations and remain stable after the perturbation is removed. Furthermore, an additional bistable intracellular feedback or operation on a growing cell lattice can make patterning robust to noise. Together, these results show that a single morphogen can be sufficient for robust spatial pattern formation and should provide a foundation for engineering pattern formation in the emerging field of synthetic developmental biology.},

   abstract = {First proposed by Turing in 1952, the eponymous Turing instability and Turing pattern remain key tools for the modern study of diffusion-driven pattern formation. In spatially homogeneous Turing systems, one or a few linear Turing modes dominate, resulting in organized patterns (peaks in one dimension; spots, stripes, labyrinths in two dimensions) which repeats in space. For a variety of reasons, there has been increasing interest in understanding irregular patterns, with spatial heterogeneity in the underlying reaction-diffusion system identified as one route to obtaining irregular patterns. We study pattern formation from reaction-diffusion systems which involve spatial heterogeneity, by way of both analytical and numerical techniques. We first extend the classical Turing instability analysis to track the evolution of linear Turing modes and the nascent pattern, resulting in a more general instability criterion which can be applied to spatially heterogeneous systems. We also calculate nonlinear mode coefficients, employing these to understand how each spatial mode influences the long-time evolution of a pattern. Unlike for the standard spatially homogeneous Turing systems, spatially heterogeneous systems may involve many Turing modes of different wavelengths interacting simultaneously, with resulting patterns exhibiting a high degree of variation over space. We provide a number of examples of spatial heterogeneity in reaction-diffusion systems, both mathematical (space-varying diffusion parameters and reaction kinetics, mixed boundary conditions, space-varying base states) and physical (curved anisotropic domains, apical growth of space domains, chemicalsimmersed within a flow or a thermal gradient), providing a qualitative understanding of how spatial heterogeneity can be used to modify classical Turing patterns.

   abstract = {Reaction–diffusion systems are an intensively studied form of partial differential equation, frequently used to produce spatially heterogeneous patterned states from homogeneous symmetry breaking via the Turing instability. Although there are many prototypical “Turing systems” available, determining their parameters, functional forms, and general appropriateness for a given application is often difficult. Here, we consider the reverse problem. Namely, suppose we know the parameter region associated with the reaction kinetics in which patterning is required—we present a constructive framework for identifying systems that will exhibit the Turing instability within this region, whilst in addition often allowing selection of desired patterning features, such as spots, or stripes. In particular, we show how to build a system of two populations governed by polynomial morphogen kinetics such that the: patterning parameter domain (in any spatial dimension), morphogen phases (in any spatial dimension), and even type of resulting pattern (in up to two spatial dimensions) can all be determined. Finally, by employing spatial and temporal heterogeneity, we demonstrate that mixed mode patterns (spots, stripes, and complex prepatterns) are also possible, allowing one to build arbitrarily complicated patterning landscapes. Such a framework can be employed pedagogically, or in a variety of contemporary applications in designing synthetic chemical and biological patterning systems. We also discuss the implications that this freedom of design has on using reaction–diffusion systems in biological modelling and suggest that stronger constraints are needed when linking theory and experiment, as many simple patterns can be easily generated given freedom to choose reaction kinetics.},

   abstract = {<p> Reaction–diffusion processes across layered media arise in several scientific domains such as pattern-forming <italic>E. coli</italic> on agar substrates, epidermal–mesenchymal coupling in development, and symmetry-breaking in cell polarization. We develop a modeling framework for bilayer reaction–diffusion systems and relate it to a range of existing models. We derive conditions for diffusion-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium analogous to the classical conditions for a Turing instability in the simplest nontrivial setting where one domain has a standard reaction–diffusion system, and the other permits only diffusion. Due to the transverse coupling between these two regions, standard techniques for computing eigenfunctions of the Laplacian cannot be applied, and so we propose an alternative method to compute the dispersion relation directly. We compare instability conditions with full numerical simulations to demonstrate impacts of the geometry and coupling parameters on patterning, and explore various experimentally relevant asymptotic regimes. In the regime where the first domain is suitably thin, we recover a simple modulation of the standard Turing conditions, and find that often the broad impact of the diffusion-only domain is to reduce the ability of the system to form patterns. We also demonstrate complex impacts of this coupling on pattern formation. For instance, we exhibit non-monotonicity of pattern-forming instabilities with respect to geometric and coupling parameters, and highlight an instability from a nontrivial interaction between kinetics in one domain and diffusion in the other. These results are valuable for informing design choices in applications such as synthetic engineering of Turing patterns, but also for understanding the role of stratified media in modulating pattern-forming processes in developmental biology and beyond. </p>},

   abstract = {Turing’s theory of morphogenesis is a generic mechanism to produce spatial patterning from near homogeneity. Although widely studied, we are still able to generate new results by returning to common dogmas. One such widely reported belief is that the Turing bifurcation occurs through a pitchfork bifurcation, which is true under zero-flux boundary conditions. However, under fixed boundary conditions, the Turing bifurcation becomes generically transcritical. We derive these algebraic results through weakly nonlinear analysis and apply them to the Schnakenberg kinetics. We observe that the combination of kinetics and boundary conditions produce their own uncommon boundary complexities that we explore numerically. Overall, this work demonstrates that it is not enough to only consider parameter perturbations in a sensitivity analysis of a specific application. Variations in boundary conditions should also be considered.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Realistic examples of reaction–diffusion phenomena governing spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation are rarely isolated systems, either chemically or thermodynamically. However, even formulations of ‘open’ reaction–diffusion systems often neglect the role of domain boundaries. Most idealizations of closed reaction–diffusion systems employ no-flux boundary conditions, and often patterns will form up to, or along, these boundaries. Motivated by boundaries of patterning fields related to the emergence of spatial form in embryonic development, we propose a set of mixed boundary conditions for a two-species reaction–diffusion system which forms inhomogeneous solutions away from the boundary of the domain for a variety of different reaction kinetics, with a prescribed uniform state near the boundary. We show that these boundary conditions can be derived from a larger heterogeneous field, indicating that these conditions can arise naturally if cell signalling or other properties of the medium vary in space. We explain the basic mechanisms behind this pattern localization and demonstrate that it can capture a large range of localized patterning in one, two, and three dimensions and that this framework can be applied to systems involving more than two species. Furthermore, the boundary conditions proposed lead to more symmetrical patterns on the interior of the domain and plausibly capture more realistic boundaries in developmental systems. Finally, we show that these isolated patterns are more robust to fluctuations in initial conditions and that they allow intriguing possibilities of pattern selection via geometry, distinct from known selection mechanisms.</p>},

   abstract = {Computing has revolutionised the study of complex nonlinear systems, both by allowing us to solve previously intractable models and through the ability to visualise solutions in different ways. Using ubiquitous computing infrastructure, we provide a means to go one step further in using computers to understand complex models through instantaneous and interactive exploration. This ubiquitous infrastructure has enormous potential in education, outreach and research. Here, we present VisualPDE, an online, interactive solver for a broad class of 1D and 2D partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Abstract dynamical systems concepts such as symmetry-breaking instabilities, subcritical bifurcations and the role of initial data in multistable nonlinear models become much more intuitive when you can play with these models yourself, and immediately answer questions about how the system responds to changes in parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions or even spatiotemporal forcing. Importantly, VisualPDE is freely available, open source and highly customisable. We give several examples in teaching, research and knowledge exchange, providing high-level discussions of how it may be employed in different settings. This includes designing web-based course materials structured around interactive simulations, or easily crafting specific simulations that can be shared with students or collaborators via a simple URL. We envisage VisualPDE becoming an invaluable resource for teaching and research in mathematical biology and beyond. We also hope that it inspires other efforts to make mathematics more interactive and accessible.},

Studies have allowed us to determine the in vivo strength of promoters and have allowed us to distinguish between factor-dependent transcriptional control of the promoter and changes in promoter activity due to changes in the concentration of free functional RNA polymerase associated with different growth conditions. The total, or bulk, amounts of RNA and protein are linked to the growth rate, because most bacterial RNA is ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Since ribosomes are required for protein synthesis, their number and their rate of function determine the rate of protein synthesis and cytoplasmic mass accumulation. Many mRNAs made in the presence of amino acids have strong ribosome binding sites whose presence reduces the expression of all other active genes. This implies that there can be profound differences in the spectrum of gene activities in cultures grown in different media that produce the same growth rate. Five classes of growth-related parameters that are generally useful in describing or establishing the macromolecular composition of bacterial cultures are described in detail in this review. A number of equations have been reported that describe the macromolecular composition of an average cell in an exponential culture as a function of the culture doubling time and five additional parameters: the C- and D-periods, protein per origin (PO), ribosome activity, and peptide chain elongation rate.</p>},

Extensive literature focuses on the linear stability analysis of homogeneous equilibria in these systems, culminating in a set of conditions for transport-driven instabilities that are commonly presumed to initiate self-organisation. We demonstrate that a selection of simple, canonical transport models with only mild multistable non-linearities can satisfy the Turing instability conditions while also robustly exhibiting only transient patterns. Hence, a Turing-like instability is insufficient for the existence of a patterned state. Given that biological systems (including gene regulatory networks and spatially distributed ecosystems) often exhibit a high degree of multistability and nonlinearity, this raises important questions of how to analyse prospective mechanisms for self-organisation.},

   abstract = {<p>We typically observe large‐scale outcomes that arise from the interactions of many hidden, small‐scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non‐neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.</p>},

They represent a major theory of patterning in tissue organisation, due to their remarkable similarity to some natural patterns, such as skin pigmentation in zebrafish2, digit spacing3,4, and many others. The involvement of Turing patterns in biology has been debated because of their stringent fine-tuning requirements, where patterns only occur within a small subset of parameters5,6. This has complicated the engineering of a synthetic gene circuit for Turing patterns from first principles, even though natural genetic Turing networks have been successfully identified4,7. Here, we engineered a synthetic genetic reaction-diffusion system where three nodes interact according to a non-classical Turing network with improved parametric robustness6. The system was optimised in E. coli and reproducibly generated stationary, periodic, concentric stripe patterns in growing colonies. The patterns were successfully reproduced with a partial differential equation model, in a parameter regime obtained by fitting to experimental data. Our synthetic Turing system can contribute to novel nanotechnologies, such as patterned biomaterial deposition8,9, and provide insights into developmental patterning programs10.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {<p>In bacterial communities, cells often communicate by the release and detection of small diffusible molecules, a process termed quorum-sensing. Signal molecules are thought to broadly diffuse in space; however, they often regulate traits such as conjugative transfer that strictly depend on the local community composition. This raises the question how nearby cells within the community can be detected. Here, we compare the range of communication of different quorum-sensing systems. While some systems support long-range communication, we show that others support a form of highly localized communication. In these systems, signal molecules propagate no more than a few microns away from signaling cells, due to the irreversible uptake of the signal molecules from the environment. This enables cells to accurately detect micron scale changes in the community composition. Several mobile genetic elements, including conjugative elements and phages, employ short-range communication to assess the fraction of susceptible host cells in their vicinity and adaptively trigger horizontal gene transfer in response. Our results underscore the complex spatial biology of bacteria, which can communicate and interact at widely different spatial scales.</p>},

To explore the spatiotemporal solutions resulting from the bifurcation, the amplitude equations of the Turing‐Turing and the Turing‐Hopf bifurcations are established via the method of multiple time scale. It is found that the model admits the nonconstant steady state, the mixed nonconstant steady state, the spatially homogeneous periodic solution, and the spatially nonhomogeneous periodic solution.

   abstract = {<p>How periodic patterns are generated is an open question. A number of mechanisms have been proposed – most famously, Turing's reaction-diffusion model. However, many theoretical and experimental studies focus on the Turing mechanism while ignoring other possible mechanisms. Here, we use a general model of periodic patterning to show that different types of mechanism (molecular, cellular, mechanical) can generate qualitatively similar final patterns. Observation of final patterns is therefore not sufficient to favour one mechanism over others. However, we propose that a mathematical approach can help to guide the design of experiments that can distinguish between different mechanisms, and illustrate the potential value of this approach with specific biological examples.</p>},

@article{Alessio2023,
   abstract = {<p>Turing patterns are fundamental in biophysics, emerging from short-range activation and long-range inhibition processes. However, their paradigm is based on diffusive transport processes that yield patterns with shallower gradients than those observed in nature. A complete physical description of this discrepancy remains unknown. We propose a solution to this phenomenon by investigating the role of diffusiophoresis, which is the propulsion of colloids by a chemical gradient, in Turing patterns. Diffusiophoresis enables robust patterning of colloidal particles with substantially finer length scales than the accompanying chemical Turing patterns. A scaling analysis and a comparison to recent experiments indicate that chromatophores, ubiquitous in biological pattern formation, are likely diffusiophoretic and the colloidal Péclet number controls the pattern enhancement. This discovery suggests that important features of biological pattern formation can be explained with a universal mechanism that is quantified straightforwardly from the fundamental physics of colloids.</p>},
