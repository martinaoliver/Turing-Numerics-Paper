\section*{Results}
To study the effects of multistability, non-linearities, boundary conditions, and growth, we use a simple reaction-diffusion model which consists of a 2-node Turing topology system with non-linear Hill functions to represent gene activation and inhibition with cooperativity.
The topology can be seen in Fig~\ref{fig1}C where the activator $A$ activates itself and the inhibitor $I$, while the inhibitor $I$ inhibits the activator $A$:

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \pdv{A}{t}=b_{A}+V_{A} \cdot\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{K_{AA}}{A}\right)^{n_{AA}}}\cdot\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{I}{K_{IA}}\right)^{n_{IA}}}-\mu_{A}\cdot A + D_{A}\nabla^2 A
    \end{equation}


    \begin{equation}
        \pdv{I}{t}=\Underbrace{\textrm{basal production}}{b_{I}}+ \Underbrace{\textrm{regulated production}}{V_{I} \cdot\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{K_{AI}}{A}\right)^{n_{AI}}}}-\Underbrace{\textrm{degradation}}{\mu_{I}\cdot I} +
        \Underbrace{\textrm{diffusion}}{D_{I}\nabla^2 I},
    \end{equation}

    \label{eq:turinghill}
\end{subequations}

with X being the concentration of species $X=A, I$ and Laplacian $\nabla^2=\partial^2/\partial x^2$ in one spatial dimension (1D). The differential equations describe the rate of change in space and time as a combination of basal production and regulated production, as well as degradation and diffusion. Parameter $b_{X}$ is the basal production rate which corresponds to the leakage of the promoter, producing molecules even when the system is fully inactivated. Furthermore, $V_{X}$ is the induced maximum production rate, $K_{XY}$ is the dissociation constant of $X$ binding to $Y$'s regulatory DNA, $n_{XY}$ is the Hill coefficient (cooperativity constant) of $X$ binding to $Y$'s regulatory DNA, and $\mu_{X}$ is the linear degradation rate of $X$. Finally, $D_{X}$ is the diffusion constant of species $X$.

The boundary conditions and domain are not strictly defined here as they vary throughout the study. The boundary conditions used are   Neumann for reflective boundaries, where the derivative at the boundary is zero, as well as Dirilichet for absorbing boundaries, where the value at the boundary is zero.
The domain used is either a fixed domain of length $L$ or a linearly, isotropically and apically growing domain, which replicates the experimental growth in 1D of the bacterial colonies in~\cite{Oliver2023} (or Fig.~\ref{fig1}A).



\subsection*{From analytical to numerical: other types of dispersion relations and patterns} \label{nogrowth}

Turing instabilities are defined using linear stability analysis (LSA) as systems which are stable without diffusion but unstable for a finite wave number as diffusion is introduced (see Methods). These Turing instabilities generally lead to stationary periodic patterns (see Fig~\ref{fig:dispersions}B). In this section, we demonstrate how sometimes the classical Turing instability theory fails to predict pattern formation.
Other types of dispersion relations beyond classical Turing instabilities can produce stationary patterns and non-stationary regular patterns that might be of interest in developmental biology.

High-throughput studies such as \cite{Scholes2019, Zheng2016, Marcon} only consider the Turing-I type dispersion for patterning and disregard the rest.
Here, we study solutions of the classical 2-node circuit (Fig~\ref{fig1}C, Eq~\ref{eq:turinghill}) and explore beyond Turing I and stationary patterns to give a more complete view of the relationship between LSA and spatio-temporal patterns. 
First, LSA was carried out, as explained in the Methods section, for particular parameter sets to find multiple steady states with different types of stability. 
Second, numerical simulations were computed using the Crank-Nicholson algorithm, where the initial condition is drawn from a random uniform distribution around a particular steady state. By classifying dispersion-relation and pattern types, we document what type of dispersion relations in mono-stable systems can be linked to what types of patterns, to gain insights into predicting pattern formation from LSA. All the solutions used in this section are mono-stable systems to ensure a direct correlation between the dispersion relation and the pattern obtained.

All types of dispersion relations in our parameter space were classified into 5 types: stable dispersion relations have all eigenvalues $\sigma$ below zero for any wavenumber $k_{n}$ (Fig ~\ref{fig:dispersions}A). Unstable dispersion relations have a positive eigenvalue at $k_{0}=0$ which eventually drops below zero as diffusion is introduced, i.e. $k_{n}>0$ (Fig~\ref{fig:dispersions}C). Hopf-type dispersion relations, as with any unstable dispersion relation, show an instability without diffusion ($\sigma>0$ for $k_{0}=0$), which eventually drops below zero for positive wavenumbers. However, in the case of the Hopf-type dispersion relation, when the eigenvalues cross the zero line, there is a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues (Fig~\ref{fig:dispersions}D).
A Hopf-type dispersion relation is different to a Hopf bifurcation: a bifurcation displays a shift in stability as a model parameter changes, while the Hopf-type dispersion is a change in stability as a function of the wavenumber $k_{n}$.
Turing I dispersion relations, as previously mentioned, are stable without diffusion, have an instability for a positive wavenumber, and finally become stable again for very large wavenumbers (Fig~\ref{fig:dispersions}B).
Turing I-Hopf dispersion relations, are a combination of Turing I and Hopf. As the Hopf-type dispersion, they are unstable without diffusion. Then, as $k_{n}$ is increased, the system becomes stable with a pair of complex conjugates as the eigenvalues cross the zero line.
Finally, a Turing I-type behaviour arises getting a peak above zero and decaying again for large wavenumbers (Fig~\ref{fig:dispersions}E).


Other types of dispersion relations exist, which are not displayed here such as Turing II. Unlike Turing I, the eigenvalues do not become stable again for very large wavenumbers.
Therefore, this system displays an instability at very large wavenumbers, which results in infinitesimally small wavelength patterns (at least for an infinite system). These are considered to produce spatially homogeneous solutions, except in the case of space discretization where they can produce small wavelength patterns~\parencite{Wang2022}.
However, Turing II solutions are not possible in systems such as this one where all nodes are diffusing.
This is because for $k_n \rightarrow \infty$, all eigenvalues $\sigma$ must be negative (see Eq~\ref{jacobian_diffusion}).

As with the classification of the dispersion relations, we classify the patterns produced numerically into homogeneous, temporal oscillator, non-stationary, and stationary patterns (see Methods and \nameref{sup_fig2}).
By classifying both LSA and numerical outputs, we can generate a confusion matrix with information about other types of dispersion relations and other types of spatio-temporal patterns (Fig~\ref{fig:dispersions}F). This confusion matrix shows that also other systems than Turing I can generate stationary spatial patterns. Unstable, Hopf and Turing I Hopf can produce such results too. Additionally, interesting behaviours can arise such as temporal oscillators and non-stationary patterns.


\subsection*{Feedbacks and non-linearities cause multi-stability}

Multi-stable systems are another case where linear stability analysis (LSA) fails to correctly predict pattern formation.  In this section, we demonstrate how LSA is neither sufficient 
nor necessary to predict Turing patterns in multi-stable system. In particular, we study in detail their dynamical behaviour, which can lead to the creation or breaking of patterns.
The motivation behind this arises from the high degree of multi-stability exhibited by biological systems, especially in those systems with non-linearities and feedback loops, as often occuring in biology or synthetic systems (see Eq~\ref{eq:turinghill})~\parencite{pham2020complexity, leite2009multistability}.

Using the two-node non-linear Turing topology (Eq~\ref{eq:turinghill}), multi-stable solutions were identified by finding the steady states of the system using the Newton-Raphson method. These multi-stable solutions were then studied to understand how the patterning dynamics are affected in the presence of multiple steady-state solutions.
As in the previous section, LSA was carried out to find multi-stable solutions and the Crank Nicholson algorithm was run to obtain the numerical solution for these.
Following the classical hypothesis used in the Turing literature, we only expected equations fulfilling the Turing conditions to produce patterns.
Here, we present various examples of how this hypothesis can break in the presence of multi-stability.

Fig~\ref{fig:multistability1} shows a case where diffusion-driven instability conditions are not required for Turing pattern formation.
The unstable state, having a negative dispersion relation  (Fig~\ref{fig:multistability1}C), manages to form a Turing pattern as the neighbouring Turing steady state attracts it.
It therefore produces a stationary pattern (Fig~\ref{fig:multistability1}B), even though its dispersion relation does not predict so.
The trajectory is depicted in the phase diagram (Fig~\ref{fig:multistability1}A) which shows the steady states along with the vector field to understand the potential trajectories of the system.
The phase diagram does not fully capture the dynamics as it describes the system without diffusion, while the dispersion relation and the numerical solution do consider diffusion.

Next, we present a case where LSA incorrectly predicts stationary pattern formation.
Fig~\ref{fig:multistability2} shows an ephemeral or transient pattern that occurs in the unstable and Turing regimes.
The Turing pattern initially develops in the vicinity of the Turing steady state.
As the spatial heterogeneity is amplified and settles, it is attracted by the stable steady state, leading to the disruption of the pattern.
This type of transient pattern behavior was also recently reported in~\cite{Krause2023}.

Other interesting examples can be found, for example, where an unstable state is surrounded by two Turing states. This unstable state leads robustly to a Turing pattern (Fig~\ref{sup_fig4}A).
Additionally, in some cases, the unstable system settles into Turing, but the Turing system gets pulled by the stable attractor (Fig ~\ref{sup_fig4}B). Additionally, some systems even exhibit three solutions which are homogeneous in time and space (Fig~\ref{sup_fig4}C). In this case, it would be worth investigating earlier time points with more resolution, as a pattern might appear then.
Similar interactions occur with multi-stability involving Turing I-Hopf solutions, which are mentioned in the following sections (Fig~\ref{sup_fig4}D).




\section*{Biological features: absorbing boundaries and growth}
As shown above, both numerical solutions and multi-stability can break the preconception that only classical Turing I systems can produce stationary periodic patterns.
Here, we look deeper into how other aspects linking the theory closer to the biological reality can also break this preconception.
In particular, we look at how adding absorbing boundaries and growth lead to a reaction-diffusion system may induce or break patterning.
This particular direction was inspired by experiments described in~\parencite{Oliver2023}, where growing bacterial colonies in agar are used as a platform to engineer Turing patterns using synthetic gene circuits (see Fig~\ref{fig1}A).

The parameter space was explored using simulations, classified as  (1) no-growth and reflective boundaries, (2) no-growth and absorbing boundaries, and finally (3) growth and absorbing boundaries. This way we can understand separately the effects of absorbing boundaries and growth in a synthetic system such as~\cite{Oliver2023}
Again, all these parameter sets have only a single steady state to ensure patterning effects are due to boundaries and growth, and not due to multi-stability.
%TODO remove ibid
When absorbing boundaries or growth are added, periodic patterns are potentially created, disrupted, or remain the same.
The Sankey diagram in Fig~\ref{fig:boundariesgrowth}A shows how this system can transition when absorbing boundaries and growth are introduced.
This transition can also be seen in Fig~\ref{sup_fig5} as a confusion matrix from reflective to absorbing boundaries and from non-growing to growing domains.
As explained in the Methods section, the classification previously used cannot be applied for absorbing boundary conditions as these prevent the pattern from being completely homogeneous or stationary.  %TODO add letter to image
Therefore, a different type of classification has to be used for reflective and absorbing boundary conditions.
For reflective boundary conditions, we classify patterns into (1) homogeneous, (2) temporal oscillators, (3) non-stationary patterns and (4) stationary patterns (see Methods and~\nameref{sup_fig2}). For absorbing boundary conditions we classify patterns into (1) homogeneous, (2) boundary effect, (3) weak pattern, (4) intermediate pattern, and (5) strong pattern (see Methods and~\nameref{sup_fig3}).
Although the classification outputs cannot be directly compared, this confusion matrix is useful for identifying interesting cases:
If absorbing boundary conditions had no effect, we would expect homogeneous and temporal oscillator categories to become no pattern, homogeneous, or boundary effect.
Additionally, we would expect stationary patterns to become strong patterns.
This is commonly the case as seen by the thicker lines in Fig~\ref{fig:boundariesgrowth}A, which shows boundaries do not often affect the pattern.
However, there are some exceptions which are further studied in Fig~\ref{fig:boundariesgrowth}B.

In particular, we observe systems where an absorbing boundary condition makes a homogeneous solution become a non-stationary pattern.
Additionally, absorbing boundary conditions can turn a temporal oscillator into a stationary pattern.
Finally, by adding growth, a non-stationary pattern can be stabilized into a growing stationary pattern.
