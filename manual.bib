Extensive literature focuses on the linear stability analysis of homogeneous equilibria in these systems, culminating in a set of conditions for transport-driven instabilities that are commonly presumed to initiate self-organisation. We demonstrate that a selection of simple, canonical transport models with only mild multistable non-linearities can satisfy the Turing instability conditions while also robustly exhibiting only transient patterns. Hence, a Turing-like instability is insufficient for the existence of a patterned state. Given that biological systems (including gene regulatory networks and spatially distributed ecosystems) often exhibit a high degree of multistability and nonlinearity, this raises important questions of how to analyse prospective mechanisms for self-organisation.},

Turing patterning provides a foundational paradigm for understanding such systems. The simplest Turing systems are believed to require at least two morphogens to generate periodic patterns. Here, using mathematical modeling, we show that a simpler circuit, including only a single diffusible morphogen, is sufficient to generate long-range, spatially periodic patterns that propagate outward from transient initiating perturbations and remain stable after the perturbation is removed. Furthermore, an additional bistable intracellular feedback or operation on a growing cell lattice can make patterning robust to noise. Together, these results show that a single morphogen can be sufficient for robust spatial pattern formation and should provide a foundation for engineering pattern formation in the emerging field of synthetic developmental biology.},

We exhaustively analyze 2- and 3-node biological candidate Turing systems, amounting to 7,625 networks and more than 3 × 1011 analyzed scenarios. We find that network structure alone neither implies nor guarantees emergent TPs. A large fraction (>61%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure, and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. We deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 92% of networks implementing them produce TPs). This comprehensive network atlas provides the blueprints for identifying natural TPs and for engineering synthetic systems.},

On the basis of many mathematical studies, it has been proposed that various biological development processes use Turing instability to achieve periodic patterns. In this paper, we introduce a framework to systematic identify network topologies that are capable for Turing pattern formation. All possible 2, 3-node genetic regulatory networks are enumerated and linear stability analysis is applied to access their ability to generate Turing instability. We find that all 3-node networks that can achieve Turing pattern can be mapped to either pure or cross activator-inhibitor mechanisms, and the pure activator-inhibitor system is more robust for Turing pattern formation than the other one. Additional linkages can further increase the performance of the circuit by either introducing another core topology or complementing existing regulations. Moreover, we find that addition of a fixed node enables the formation of Turing pattern even when the diffusion coefficients of two morphogens are fairly close to each other. Our results provide the design principle of robust circuits for Turing pattern generation and can be further applied for systematically exploring other bifurcation phenomena.},

   abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts.

   abstract = {<p>Realistic examples of reaction–diffusion phenomena governing spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation are rarely isolated systems, either chemically or thermodynamically. However, even formulations of ‘open’ reaction–diffusion systems often neglect the role of domain boundaries. Most idealizations of closed reaction–diffusion systems employ no-flux boundary conditions, and often patterns will form up to, or along, these boundaries. Motivated by boundaries of patterning fields related to the emergence of spatial form in embryonic development, we propose a set of mixed boundary conditions for a two-species reaction–diffusion system which forms inhomogeneous solutions away from the boundary of the domain for a variety of different reaction kinetics, with a prescribed uniform state near the boundary. We show that these boundary conditions can be derived from a larger heterogeneous field, indicating that these conditions can arise naturally if cell signalling or other properties of the medium vary in space. We explain the basic mechanisms behind this pattern localization and demonstrate that it can capture a large range of localized patterning in one, two, and three dimensions and that this framework can be applied to systems involving more than two species. Furthermore, the boundary conditions proposed lead to more symmetrical patterns on the interior of the domain and plausibly capture more realistic boundaries in developmental systems. Finally, we show that these isolated patterns are more robust to fluctuations in initial conditions and that they allow intriguing possibilities of pattern selection via geometry, distinct from known selection mechanisms.</p>},

Although widely studied, we are still able to generate new results by returning to common dogmas.

However, under fixed boundary conditions, the Turing bifurcation becomes generically transcritical. We derive these algebraic results through weakly nonlinear analysis and apply them to the Schnakenberg kinetics. We observe that the combination of kinetics and boundary conditions produce their own uncommon boundary complexities that we explore numerically.

   abstract = {<p> Reaction–diffusion processes across layered media arise in several scientific domains such as pattern-forming <italic>E. coli</italic> on agar substrates, epidermal–mesenchymal coupling in development, and symmetry-breaking in cell polarization. We develop a modeling framework for bilayer reaction–diffusion systems and relate it to a range of existing models. We derive conditions for diffusion-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium analogous to the classical conditions for a Turing instability in the simplest nontrivial setting where one domain has a standard reaction–diffusion system, and the other permits only diffusion. Due to the transverse coupling between these two regions, standard techniques for computing eigenfunctions of the Laplacian cannot be applied, and so we propose an alternative method to compute the dispersion relation directly. We compare instability conditions with full numerical simulations to demonstrate impacts of the geometry and coupling parameters on patterning, and explore various experimentally relevant asymptotic regimes. In the regime where the first domain is suitably thin, we recover a simple modulation of the standard Turing conditions, and find that often the broad impact of the diffusion-only domain is to reduce the ability of the system to form patterns. We also demonstrate complex impacts of this coupling on pattern formation. For instance, we exhibit non-monotonicity of pattern-forming instabilities with respect to geometric and coupling parameters, and highlight an instability from a nontrivial interaction between kinetics in one domain and diffusion in the other. These results are valuable for informing design choices in applications such as synthetic engineering of Turing patterns, but also for understanding the role of stratified media in modulating pattern-forming processes in developmental biology and beyond. </p>},

Such systems are often considered on a growing domain, but traditional theoretical studies have only treated the domain size as a bifurcation parameter, neglecting the system non-autonomy. More recently, the conditions for a diffusively driven instability on a growing domain have been determined under stringent conditions, including slow growth, a restriction on the temporal interval over which the prospect of an instability can be considered and a neglect of the impact that time evolution has on the stability properties of the homogeneous reference state from which heterogeneity emerges. Here, we firstly relax this latter assumption and observe that the conditions for the Turing instability are much more complex and depend on the history of the system in general. We proceed to relax all the above constraints, making analytical progress by focusing on specific examples. With faster growth, instabilities can grow transiently and decay, making the prediction of a prospective Turing instability much more difficult. In addition, arbitrarily high spatial frequencies can destabilize, in which case the continuum approximation is predicted to break down.},

   abstract = {One of the elementary processes in morphogenesis is the formation of a spatial pattern of tissue structures, starting from almost homogeneous tissue. It will be shown that relatively simple molecular mechanisms based on auto-and cross catalysis can account for a primary pattern of morphogens to determine pattern formation of the tissue. The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto-and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation. Employing an approximative equation, a criterium is derived for models, which lead to a striking pattern, starting from an even distribution of morphogens, and assuming a shallow source gradient. The polarity of the pattern depends on the direction of the source gradient, but can be rather independent of other features of source distribution, Models are proposed which explain size regulation (constant proportion of the parts of the pattern irrespective of total size). Depending on the choice of constants, aperiodic patterns, implying a one-to-one correlation between morphogen concentration and position in the tissue, or nearly periodic patterns can be obtained. The theory can be applied not only to multicellular tissues, but also to intracellular differentiation, e.g. of polar cells. The theory permits various molecular interpretations. One of the simplest models involves bimolecular activation and mono-molecular inhibition. Source gradients may be substituted by, or added to, sink gradients, e.g. of degrading enzymes. Inhibitors can be substituted by substances required for, and depleted by activation. Sources may be either synthesizing systems or particulate structures releasing activators and inhibitors. Calculations by computer are presented to exemplify the main features of the theory proposed. The theory is applied to quantitative data on hydra-a suitable one-dimensional model for pattern formation-and is shown to account for activation and inhibition of secondary head formation.},

   abstract = {The origin of biological morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator–inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator–inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator–inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.},

@article{Sekine2018,
   abstract = {A synthetic mammalian reaction-diffusion pattern has yet to be created, and Nodal-Lefty signaling has been proposed to meet conditions for pattern formation: Nodal is a short-range activator whereas Lefty is a long-range inhibitor. However, this pattern forming possibility has never been directly tested, and the underlying mechanisms of differential diffusivity of Nodal and Lefty remain unclear. Here, through a combination of synthetic and theoretical approaches, we show that a reconstituted Nodal-Lefty network in mammalian cells spontaneously gives rise to a pattern. Surprisingly, extracellular Nodal is confined underneath the cells, resulting in a narrow distribution compared with Lefty. The short-range distribution requires the finger 1 domain of Nodal, and transplantation of the finger 1 domain into Lefty shortens the distribution of Lefty, successfully preventing pattern formation. These results indicate that the differences in localization and domain structures between Nodal and Lefty, combined with the activator-inhibitor topology, are sufficient for reaction-diffusion patterning.},

   note = {The concept of a self-organizing RD system was first proposed by Alan Turing as a chemical system of interacting and diffusible molecules giving rise to various stable patterns, such as spots and stripes11–14. <br/>In the field of synthetic biology, a regular stripe pattern has been created in colonies of engineered bacteria, in which diffusion of the small molecule AHL regulates the motility of the actively swimming bacteria22, and this patterning mechanism can be considered as a non-classic RD system. Very recently, a stochastic Turing pattern has been created in engi- neered bacteria that have a synthetic network of two diffusible small molecules23. <br/>First eukaryotic and protein based RD patterning system<br/>Nodal and lefty have different diffusivities. The mechanism for its differential diffusivities is still yet unknown.

This non- Turing patterning mechanism is essentially the same as the for- mation of “solitary localized structures”41,42 caused by an exci- table or bistable system combined with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor: the positive domains are formed by short-range self- activation initially, and the propagation of domains are stopped by long-range inhibition in the later stage. One qualitative dif- ference between the solitary and Turing patterns is that a solitary pattern depends on the initial condition while a Turing pattern does not essentially vary according to the initial conditio <br/>It is a solitary pattern in this case because when the initial condition was altered, the turing synthetic RD pattern in vivo varied.<br/>While pattern formation is fundamental for embryonic devel- opment, investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms in complex living tissues is often difficult. A simple synthetic system in cell culture should offer a unique opportunity to investigate the <br/>mechanisms of pattern formation and morphogen diffusion in detail. This work will also serve as a base for engineering a more complex synthetic tissue},
