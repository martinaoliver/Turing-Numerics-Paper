Extensive literature focuses on the linear stability analysis of homogeneous equilibria in these systems, culminating in a set of conditions for transport-driven instabilities that are commonly presumed to initiate self-organisation. We demonstrate that a selection of simple, canonical transport models with only mild multistable non-linearities can satisfy the Turing instability conditions while also robustly exhibiting only transient patterns. Hence, a Turing-like instability is insufficient for the existence of a patterned state. Given that biological systems (including gene regulatory networks and spatially distributed ecosystems) often exhibit a high degree of multistability and nonlinearity, this raises important questions of how to analyse prospective mechanisms for self-organisation.},

   abstract = {During multicellular development, periodic spatial patterning systems generate repetitive structures, such as digits, vertebrae, and teeth. Turing patterning provides a foundational paradigm for understanding such systems. The simplest Turing systems are believed to require at least two morphogens to generate periodic patterns. Here, using mathematical modeling, we show that a simpler circuit, including only a single diffusible morphogen, is sufficient to generate long-range, spatially periodic patterns that propagate outward from transient initiating perturbations and remain stable after the perturbation is removed. Furthermore, an additional bistable intracellular feedback or operation on a growing cell lattice can make patterning robust to noise. Together, these results show that a single morphogen can be sufficient for robust spatial pattern formation and should provide a foundation for engineering pattern formation in the emerging field of synthetic developmental biology.},

Here we explore TP design space to address this question and to distill design rules. We exhaustively analyze 2- and 3-node biological candidate Turing systems, amounting to 7,625 networks and more than 3 × 1011 analyzed scenarios. We find that network structure alone neither implies nor guarantees emergent TPs. A large fraction (>61%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure, and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. We deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 92% of networks implementing them produce TPs). This comprehensive network atlas provides the blueprints for identifying natural TPs and for engineering synthetic systems.},

On the basis of many mathematical studies, it has been proposed that various biological development processes use Turing instability to achieve periodic patterns. In this paper, we introduce a framework to systematic identify network topologies that are capable for Turing pattern formation. All possible 2, 3-node genetic regulatory networks are enumerated and linear stability analysis is applied to access their ability to generate Turing instability. We find that all 3-node networks that can achieve Turing pattern can be mapped to either pure or cross activator-inhibitor mechanisms, and the pure activator-inhibitor system is more robust for Turing pattern formation than the other one. Additional linkages can further increase the performance of the circuit by either introducing another core topology or complementing existing regulations. Moreover, we find that addition of a fixed node enables the formation of Turing pattern even when the diffusion coefficients of two morphogens are fairly close to each other. Our results provide the design principle of robust circuits for Turing pattern generation and can be further applied for systematically exploring other bifurcation phenomena.},

@article{Turing1952,
   abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

   abstract = {<p>Realistic examples of reaction–diffusion phenomena governing spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation are rarely isolated systems, either chemically or thermodynamically. However, even formulations of ‘open’ reaction–diffusion systems often neglect the role of domain boundaries. Most idealizations of closed reaction–diffusion systems employ no-flux boundary conditions, and often patterns will form up to, or along, these boundaries. Motivated by boundaries of patterning fields related to the emergence of spatial form in embryonic development, we propose a set of mixed boundary conditions for a two-species reaction–diffusion system which forms inhomogeneous solutions away from the boundary of the domain for a variety of different reaction kinetics, with a prescribed uniform state near the boundary. We show that these boundary conditions can be derived from a larger heterogeneous field, indicating that these conditions can arise naturally if cell signalling or other properties of the medium vary in space. We explain the basic mechanisms behind this pattern localization and demonstrate that it can capture a large range of localized patterning in one, two, and three dimensions and that this framework can be applied to systems involving more than two species. Furthermore, the boundary conditions proposed lead to more symmetrical patterns on the interior of the domain and plausibly capture more realistic boundaries in developmental systems. Finally, we show that these isolated patterns are more robust to fluctuations in initial conditions and that they allow intriguing possibilities of pattern selection via geometry, distinct from known selection mechanisms.</p>},

Although widely studied, we are still able to generate new results by returning to common dogmas. One such widely reported belief is that the Turing bifurcation occurs through a pitchfork bifurcation, which is true under zero-flux boundary conditions. However, under fixed boundary conditions, the Turing bifurcation becomes generically transcritical. We derive these algebraic results through weakly nonlinear analysis and apply them to the Schnakenberg kinetics. We observe that the combination of kinetics and boundary conditions produce their own uncommon boundary complexities that we explore numerically. Overall, this work demonstrates that it is not enough to only consider parameter perturbations in a sensitivity analysis of a specific application.

   abstract = {<p> Reaction–diffusion processes across layered media arise in several scientific domains such as pattern-forming <italic>E. coli</italic> on agar substrates, epidermal–mesenchymal coupling in development, and symmetry-breaking in cell polarization. We develop a modeling framework for bilayer reaction–diffusion systems and relate it to a range of existing models. We derive conditions for diffusion-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium analogous to the classical conditions for a Turing instability in the simplest nontrivial setting where one domain has a standard reaction–diffusion system, and the other permits only diffusion. Due to the transverse coupling between these two regions, standard techniques for computing eigenfunctions of the Laplacian cannot be applied, and so we propose an alternative method to compute the dispersion relation directly. We compare instability conditions with full numerical simulations to demonstrate impacts of the geometry and coupling parameters on patterning, and explore various experimentally relevant asymptotic regimes. In the regime where the first domain is suitably thin, we recover a simple modulation of the standard Turing conditions, and find that often the broad impact of the diffusion-only domain is to reduce the ability of the system to form patterns. We also demonstrate complex impacts of this coupling on pattern formation. For instance, we exhibit non-monotonicity of pattern-forming instabilities with respect to geometric and coupling parameters, and highlight an instability from a nontrivial interaction between kinetics in one domain and diffusion in the other. These results are valuable for informing design choices in applications such as synthetic engineering of Turing patterns, but also for understanding the role of stratified media in modulating pattern-forming processes in developmental biology and beyond. </p>},

Such systems are often considered on a growing domain, but traditional theoretical studies have only treated the domain size as a bifurcation parameter, neglecting the system non-autonomy. More recently, the conditions for a diffusively driven instability on a growing domain have been determined under stringent conditions, including slow growth, a restriction on the temporal interval over which the prospect of an instability can be considered and a neglect of the impact that time evolution has on the stability properties of the homogeneous reference state from which heterogeneity emerges. Here, we firstly relax this latter assumption and observe that the conditions for the Turing instability are much more complex and depend on the history of the system in general. We proceed to relax all the above constraints, making analytical progress by focusing on specific examples. With faster growth, instabilities can grow transiently and decay, making the prediction of a prospective Turing instability much more difficult. In addition, arbitrarily high spatial frequencies can destabilize, in which case the continuum approximation is predicted to break down.},
