\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Multistability in Turing}

In this section, we demonstrate how linear stability analysis is not sufficient or necessary to predict Turing patterns (TPs) in multi-stable systems.
In particular, we study in detail the dynamical behaviour of multi-stable systems during pattern formation, which will lead to the creation or breaking of the pattern.
The motivation behind this arises from the high degree of multistability exhibited by biological systems, where cell-fate decisions have to be taken within this landscape ~\parencite{huang2000shape,moris2016transition}.
Multistability is especially common in systems with non-linearities and feedback loops, as the ones in biology or in our models~\parencite{pham2020complexity, leite2009multistability}.

Using the two-node non-linear Turing topology (Eq. \ref{eq:turinghill}), multi-stable solutions were found and studied to understand how the patterning dynamics get affected when multiple steady-state solutions are found.
First, LSA is carried out on particular parameter sets to find multiple steady states with different stability nature (e.g.~stable, unstable, Turing I, Turing I-Hopf).
Then numerical simulations are computed where the initial condition is a random uniform distribution around a particular steady state.
Different pattern outcomes result depending on where in the phase diagram the initial condition is.
Following the classical hypothesis used in the Turing robustness literature, we would expect stable and unstable systems to not produce patterns and Turing to produce patterns.
Here, we present various examples of how this hypothesis can break under multistability conditions.

Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1} shows a case where diffusion-driven instability conditions are not required for Turing pattern formation.
The unstable state, having a dispersion relation with a peak below zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}C), managed to get into a Turing pattern regime as it is attracted by the neighbouring Turing steady state.
It therefore produces a stationary pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}B), even though its dispersion relation does not predict so.
This trajectory is depicted in the phase diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}A) which shows the steady states along with the vector field to understand the potential trajectories of the system.
The phase diagram does not fully capture the dynamics as it describes the system without diffusion, while the dispersion relation and the numerical solution do consider diffusion.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/multistability1}

    \caption{{\bf Stationary Patterns in multistability.} \textbf{(A)} Phase diagram without diffusion illustrating three distinct steady states where the derivative is zero: stable, unstable, and stable (Turing). These steady states are represented within a parameter space defined by two axes: concentrations of A and I. The vector field, indicated by light green arrows, shows the direction of the derivatives of the system at various points in the parameter space. A hand-drawn trajectory is also shown (dark green arrow), demonstrating how the unstable state may evolve into the Turing state. \textbf{(B)} Dispersion relation showing each type of state. \textbf{(C)} Numerical solutions of the three steady states with diffusion, where the unstable state unexpectedly produces a Turing-like stationary pattern.}
    \label{fig2}
\end{figure}


Then, we present a case where LSA incorrectly predicts stationary pattern formation.
Fig.~\ref{fig:fig2} shows an ephemeral or transient pattern that occurs in the unstable and Turing regimes.
The TP initially develops in the vicinity of the Turing steady state.
As the spatial heterogeneity is amplified and settles, it gets attracted by the stable steady state leading to the disruption of the pattern.
This type of transient pattern behaviour has also been recently reported in~\cite{Krause2023}.

        \textbf{(A)} Phase diagram without diffusion illustrating three distinct steady states where the derivative is zero.

Unstable and Turing produce temporary periodic stationary patterns, that then disappear and become spatially homogeneous solutions.}
    \label{fig3}
\end{figure}



% Other interesting examples can be found, for example, where an unstable state is surrounded by two Turing states, this unstable state will robustly lead to a Turing pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:multistability_leftover}A).
% Additionally, in some cases, the unstable system settles into Turing, but the Turing system gets pulled by the stable attractor (Fig.~\ref{fig:multistability_leftover}B). Additionally, some systems even exhibit three solutions which are homogeneous in time and space (Fig.~\ref{fig:multistability_leftover}C).
% In this case, it would be worth investigating earlier time points with more resolution, as a pattern might appear then.
% Interesting interactions similarly occur with multistability involving Turing I-Hopf solutions which will be mentioned in the following sections (Fig.~\ref{fig:multistability_leftover}D).

\subsection*{Beyond the classical dispersion relation}
Multi-stable systems are not the only case where the classical Turing instability theory fails to predict pattern formation.
Other types of dispersion relations beyond classical Turing instabilities can produce stationary patterns and non-stationary regular patterns that might be of interest in developmental biology.
This section aims to document what type of dispersion relations in mono-stable systems can be linked to what type of patterns, to gain insights into predicting pattern formation from linear stability analysis.
We will first present a classification for the different types of dispersion relations.
Subsequently, we will show the classification for the different types of pattern outcomes, where the system is defined in a non-growing domain with reflective boundary conditions (Neumann, where the derivative is zero at the boundary).
Finally, we will reconstruct the 2x2 confusion matrix (Fig.~\ref{fig:lsa_numerical_confusion_literature}) currently used as an assumption in the literature, to show a more complete view on how to interpret dispersion relations.
The new confusion matrix will show more types of dispersion relation and more pattern outcomes leading to a 5x4 confusion matrix.

First, we classify the different dispersion relations obtained from LSA into 5 types:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Stable dispersion relations (Fig~\ref{fig:fig4}A) have all eigenvalues $\sigma$ below zero for any wavenumber $k_{n}$.
%     \item Unstable dispersion relations (Fig~\ref{fig:fig4}B) have a positive eigenvalue at $k_{0}=0$ which eventually drops below zero as diffusion is introduced (i.e. $k_{n}>0$).
%     \item Hopf-type dispersion relations, as with any unstable dispersion relation, shows an instability without diffusion ($\sigma>0$ for $k_{0}=0$) which eventually drops below zero for positive wavenumbers.
% However, in the case of the Hopf-type dispersion relation, when the eigenvalues cross the zero line, there is a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues (Fig~\ref{fig:fig4}C).
% A Hopf-like dispersion relation is different to a Hopf bifurcation: a bifurcation displays a shift in stability as a model parameter changes, while the Hopf-like dispersion is a change in stability as a function of the wavenumber $k_{n}$.
% %In this case, the bifurcation parameter would be $k$, making the system go from unstable to stable by changing this parameter.
% \item Turing I dispersion relations, as previously mentioned, are stable without diffusion, have an instability for a positive wavenumber, and finally become stable again for very large wavenumbers (Fig~\ref{fig:fig4}D).
% \item Turing I-Hopf dispersion relations, are a combination of Turing I and Hopf-type dispersion relations.
% As the Hopf-type dispersion, they are unstable without diffusion.
% Then, as $k_{n}$ is increased, the system becomes stable with a pair of complex conjugates as the eigenvalues cross the zero line.
% Finally, a Turing I-type behaviour arises getting a peak above zero and decaying again for large wavenumbers (Fig~\ref{fig:fig4}E).
% \end{itemize}

Other types of dispersion relation exist which are not displayed here such as Turing II, where the eigenvalues do not become stable again for very large wavenumbers.
Therefore, this system displays an instability at very large wavenumbers which results in infinitesimally small wavelength patterns.
These are considered to produce homogeneous solutions, except in the case of space discretization where they can produce small wavelength patterns~\parencite{Wang2022}.
However, Turing II solutions are not possible in systems such as this one where all nodes are diffusing.
This is because for $k_n \rightarrow \inf$, all eigenvalues $\sigma$ must be negative (see Eq.~\ref{jacobian_diffusion}).

% \begin{figure}[!h]
%     \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/dispersion}

%     \caption{{\bf Different types of dispersion relation.}
%         Dispersion relation shows the eigenvalue as a function of wavenumber. The continuous line represents the real part, while the dotted line represents the imaginary part. \textbf{(A) Stable:} all eigenvalues are below zero. \textbf{(B) Unstable:} eigenvalues at $k_{n}$=0 are positive meaning the system is unstable without diffusion. \textbf{(C) Hopf:}~unstable type, with hopf bifurcation for parameter wavenumber $k_{n}$. For a certain $k_{n}$, the system flips from unstable to stable, crossing the zero eigenvalue line. At the crossing, there is a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. \textbf{(D) Turing I:} the dispersion shows a diffusion driven instability. At $k_{n}$=0, the system is stable and has negative eigenvalues. As diffusion is introduced, $k_{n}$>0, the system becomes unstable and stable again for high $k$ values. \textbf{(E) Turing I-Hopf:} a combination of Turing I and Hopf, meaning the system starts as a Hopf with a positive eigenvalue at $k_{n}$=0, then the system transitions to stable with a pair of complex conjugates. Finally, there is a dispersion peak characteristic of Turing that drops for high values of $k$.}
%     \label{fig4}
% \end{figure}


As with the classification of the dispersion relations, we develop a method to classify the patterns produced numerically into homogeneous, temporal oscillator, non-stationary pattern and stationary pattern.
By classifying both LSA and numerical outputs, we can generate a new confusion matrix with information about other types of dispersion relations and other types of spatio-temporal patterns.

We use a decision tree for the classification where the two layers are spatial homogeneity and convergence in time, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:no growth classification}.
This decision tree leads to the 4 types of patterns mentioned.
A pattern will be considered spatially homogeneous if the final snapshot $U$ for any of the two molecular species fulfils the following condition
\begin{equation}
    \frac{max(U) - min(U)}{max(U)} \leq 0.01
\end{equation}
A pattern will be considered converged if the last 30 time points for any of the two molecular species fulfils the following condition
\begin{equation}
    \frac{max(U[-30:]) - min(U[-30:])}{max(U[-30:])} \leq 0.05
\end{equation}
The thresholds chosen were fine-tuned by testing them on the numerical patterns to obtain the best classification results.
Using these two characteristics, spatial homogeneity and convergence, we can obtain 4 classes of patterns as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:no growth classification}:
 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Homogeneous patterns are homogeneous in space and converge in time.
%     \item Temporal oscillators, also called limit cycles, are homogeneous in space but do not converge, as they oscillate in time.
%     \item Non-stationary patterns are not homogeneous in space and do not converge in time.
%     \item Finally, Stationary patterns are not homogeneous in space but converge in time.

High-throughput studies like~\cite{Scholes2019, Zheng2016, Marcon} only consider Turing I as patterning and the rest is discarded.
Here, we explore beyond Turing I and stationary patterns to give a more complete view of the relationship between linear stability and spatio-temporal patterns.
9,087 parameter sets are analysed from the non-linear Turing model (Eqs. \ref{eq:turinghill}) to obtain dispersion relations and numerical patterns.
Because systems such as Turing and Turing I-Hopf are undersampled in the parameter space, the dataset is enriched with them to ensure we capture enough distinct dynamical behaviours.
Multi-stable systems are not included in this analysis to understand the direct relationships between the dispersion relation and numerics.
The two types of classifications described above are applied, and a new 5x4 confusion matrix is generated (Fig.~\ref{fig:lsa_numerical_confusion}).



It is worth pointing out some interesting examples obtained from this confusion matrix.
For example, Turing I-Hopf seems to lead to stationary patterns often (see Fig.~\ref{fig:interesting_cases_nogrowth}A), meaning they would need to be investigated in high-throughput robustness studies.
The production of periodic patterns by Turing I-Hopf instabilities has been already documented in the literature~\cite{Liu2007}.
Some unstable dispersion relations can also lead to stationary patterns (see Fig.~\ref{fig:interesting_cases_nogrowth}B).
Additionally, Hopf solutions display interesting non-stationary patterns (see Fig.~\ref{fig:interesting_cases_nogrowth}C).
Unfortunately, some Hopf solutions are misclassified as Stationary patterns (see Fig.~\ref{fig:interesting_cases_nogrowth}D) due to an inadequate threshold of the convergence classification.
In this specific case, a higher window than 30 should be taken when considering convergence and a higher threshold for homogeneity.
It is important to understand that this is an initial exploratory analysis where misclassification might occur.
This is because of the difficulty of setting common thresholds for a wide variety of numerical solutions with different wavelengths, time scales and dynamic ranges.
